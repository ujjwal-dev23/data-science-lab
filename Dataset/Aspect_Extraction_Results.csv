AirIndia,8.0,for the price paid flight was pretty good,T Reddy,2024-09-26,it seems that on the early morning departure from bom to ccu they have upgraded their aircraft from the a320 to the a321 which resulted in additional seating and so i was able to get a seat onboard this flight departure was on time and for breakfast had opted for the omelet with hash browns which was good the crew were quite nice during this flight and landing into calcutta was timely for the price paid the flight was pretty good,1,"['the early morning departure', 'bom', 'ccu', 'their aircraft', 'the a320', 'the a321', 'additional seating', 'a seat', 'this flight departure', 'time', 'breakfast', 'the omelet', 'hash browns', 'the crew', 'this flight', 'landing', 'calcutta', 'the price', 'the flight']"
AirIndia,1.0,the experience was extremely poor,Joshua Heath,2024-09-26,i flew from sydney to delhi on flight ai301 and the experience was extremely poor unacceptable service from the onboard crew throughout the flight before take off a ground crew member came onboard to inform me the entertainment system at my seat was not working i was given the following 3 options option 1 they would try and get me on a flight the next day i was traveling for business with multiple meetings booked for my arrival in delhi which could not be changed i declined this offer option 2 downgrade to economy i declined this offer option 3 sign a form giving me rs 10000 credit approximately 180aud i accepted this offer however considering my flight was 12 hours with no entertainment the compensation offered was extremely disappointing inadequate and not reflective of the situation i was faced with the most shocking part of the flight which was completely inappropriate were the crew members that took their sleep breaks in seat e  f of row 1 business class seats in total i counted 6 different crew taking their sleep breaks for around 45min  1hour with some even changing into sleepwear absolutely appalling i did not pay a full business class fare to be seated in a crew rest area unexceptionable and disgraceful at what stage of air travel did crew sleep in passenger seats let alone in business class throughout my flight it was exceedingly difficult to get a crew members attention even after pressing my call button crew would walk straight pass my seat which i witnessed this among other passengers as well i had to get up from me seat twice during my flight to go and ask a crew member in the galley for assistance non of the crew were helpful or polite and i was made to feel like i was an inconvenience to their journey i contact air india via email following my flight regarding the crew taking their rest breaks in the business class cabin astonishingly i was informed that crew are permitted to rest in vacant seats so unless you want to sit next to the crew taking it their rest breaks i recommend avoiding air india,0,"['sydney', 'delhi', 'flight', 'ai301', 'the experience', 'extremely poor unacceptable service', 'the onboard crew', 'the flight', 'a ground crew member', 'the entertainment system', 'my seat', 'the following 3 options option', 'a flight', 'business', 'multiple meetings', 'my arrival', 'delhi', 'this offer option', 'economy', 'this offer option', 'a form', 'rs 10000 credit', 'this offer', 'my flight', '12 hours', 'no entertainment', 'the compensation', 'the situation', 'the most shocking part', 'the flight', 'the crew members', 'their sleep breaks', 'seat e  f', 'row', '1 business class seats', 'total', '6 different crew', 'their sleep breaks', '45min', 'sleepwear', 'a full business class fare', 'a crew rest area', 'what stage', 'air travel', 'crew sleep', 'passenger seats', 'business class', 'my flight', 'a crew members attention', 'my call button crew', 'my seat', 'other passengers', 'my flight', 'a crew member', 'the galley', 'assistance', 'non', 'the crew', 'an inconvenience', 'their journey', 'air india', 'email', 'my flight', 'the crew', 'their rest breaks', 'the business class cabin', 'that crew', 'vacant seats', 'the crew', 'their rest breaks', 'air india']"

AirIndia,1.0,poor management and bad decisions,O Shaw,2024-05-17,the airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more when the tatas took over people had high hope for its recovery however even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse i avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless i have no better options its a big let down for a tata company i do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as air india is now i also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top campbell wilson this guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for economy passengers this guy says this is in line with the industry trend well i dont think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines even japan airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights so what is the difference between ai and the other budget airlines offering the same 15 kgs in my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my inbound flight from tokyo i called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore i wish to cancel i was told that i can cancel but there will be no refund i have never had issues with their star alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and i get a full refund in case of cancellation not only star alliance but numerous airlines with one world and sky team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit obviously this is another similarity with budget airlines i definitely cannot recommend this airline in its current avatar unless there is a drastic change which i do not see happening any time soon definitely not under a ceo who is trying to run it as a budget airline i also understand that the airline is currently at a loss however with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty,0,"['the airline', 'a downhill spiral', 'almost 16 years', 'the tatas', 'people', 'high hope', 'its recovery', '28 months', 'things', 'this airline', 'no better options', 'a tata company', 'any other business', 'this group', 'air india', 'one reason', 'the airline', 'the guy', 'the top campbell wilson', 'this guy', 'a lot', 'management experience', 'a budget airline', 'that manner', 'just a recent example', 'the reduction', 'baggage allowance', 'domestic flights', '16 kgs', 'economy passengers', 'this guy', 'line', 'the industry trend', 'the budget airlines', 'even japan airlines', '23 kgs', 'its domestic flights', 'the difference', 'ai', 'the other budget airlines', 'the same 15 kgs', 'my recent case', 'the timing', 'my flight', 'enough time', 'my inbound flight', 'tokyo', 'the new timing', 'no refund', 'issues', 'their star alliance partner airlines', 'flight timings', 'a full refund', 'case', 'cancellation', 'not only star alliance', 'numerous airlines', 'one world and sky team', 'a full refund', 'new flight timings', 'another similarity', 'budget airlines', 'this airline', 'its current avatar', 'a drastic change', 'a ceo', 'a budget airline', 'the airline', 'a loss', 'poor management', 'bad decisions', 'further loyalty']"
AirIndia,1.0, disaster from start to finish,R Parjun,2024-05-17,my recent experience with air india on a longhaul flight from melbourne to hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare from start to finish the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied  the food served was not only of poor quality but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing to add insult to injury the taste was abysmal and the quality of desserts was subpar failing to meet even the most basic expectations moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself the state of the toilets was deplorable broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers its unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions furthermore the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age with technology readily available theres no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity especially during a lengthy 20hour flight speaking of discomfort the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless and if the inflight experience wasnt bad enough the ordeal continued upon arrival at delhi airport the mishandling of baggage collection with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings in conclusion my experience with air india was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish the combination of poor food quality unsanitary conditions lack of entertainment uncomfortable seating and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again its truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards and i urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering air india for their travels,0,"['my recent experience', 'air india', 'a longhaul flight', 'melbourne', 'hyderabad', 'a nightmare', 'start', 'the journey', 'a series', 'disappointments', 'discomforts', 'the food', 'poor quality', 'a manner', 'utter disregard', 'basic hygiene standards packages', 'had spills', 'the exterior', 'meals', 'insult', 'the taste', 'the quality', 'desserts', 'even the most basic expectations', 'the condition', 'the aircraft', 'the state', 'the toilets', 'deplorable broken toilet doors', 'malfunctioning facilities', 'a pervasive stench', 'the seating area', 'an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere', 'passengers', 'customers', 'such unsanitary conditions', 'furthermore the lack', 'inflight entertainment', 'a significant portion', 'the seats', 'this day', 'age', 'technology', 'no reason', 'passengers', 'this basic amenity', 'a lengthy 20hour flight speaking', 'discomfort', 'the seating arrangements', 'satisfactory uncomfortable seats', 'the already arduous journey', 'passengers', 'the inflight experience', 'the ordeal', 'arrival', 'delhi airport', 'the mishandling', 'baggage collection', 'staff', 'bags', 'the belt', 'created chaos', 'confusion', 'passengers', 'their belongings', 'conclusion', 'my experience', 'air india', 'a disaster', 'start', 'the combination', 'poor food quality unsanitary conditions lack', 'entertainment uncomfortable seating', 'chaotic baggage handling', 'a strong resolve', 'such a renowned airline fall', 'acceptable standards', 'prospective passengers', 'air india', 'their travels']"

AirIndia,1.0,a very bad experience,Akshay Jain,2024-02-02,a very bad experience it was a 125 hr flight from delhi to sydney supposed to take off at 215pm on 13th jan from delhi firstly i reach the check in counter at 1145 am and stood in the queue there are so many counters for air india but any counter is not for a particular air india flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for sydney or dubai or london or xyz destination secondly there were so long queue that by the time i reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by so finally at 1pm i reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop while the staff was checking my flight details i just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 430 pm instead of 215 pm  then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 430pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in so which means i had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs after that i have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage what a waste of time 1hr later at roughly around 215 pm i went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information finally i did a baggage drop and went further for a security check after security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm i still had another 1 hr with nothing to do i had thought i will be in flight already 215 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either slowly some time passed by and at 345 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 530 take off this meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off then at 445 finally they started the boarding so finally i had some relief and thought ok no more delays now  almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 515 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight 10 minutes the passenger finally came the flight finally started a take off at 545 pm after all this once the flight was in the air around 615 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time finally at 645 they provided snacks and drinks  also from the time i sat in the plan the tv was not working at all i informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food they started serving food at 645 pm and finished by 745 pm  i told then again about the tv and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up so i thought probably by 815 at least i should be able to watch something  once the reset was completed and i turned on the tv but still it was not fixed basically i had to stay for the entire 13 hrs flight without tv i had no option left but go to sleep first long wait for check in  second

AirIndia,8.0,the soft product was markedly improved,V Reddy,2023-11-21,i had booked initially on economy class for this flight but was able to upgrade to business as there were a couple of seats available which came at a fee and i really wanted to see how things have changed especially on the business class after the takeover so thought this was a good opportunity there is a separate counter for business class passengers where the staff was able to courteously check in and provide the lounge access voucher as well the flight was delayed as the incoming flight was delayed and the crew were able to proactively communicate this fact to the passengers including the arrival of the flight which was good it seems that even though the seats are quite spacious this airbus 321 was also showing its signs of ageing as well the seat also had newspapers  magazines which once could read but there was definitely an upgrade of the soft aspects of the product on board the crew were welcoming and as a welcome drink there was a choice between buttermilk and coconut water and they have had also given hot towels which was very greatly appreciated as they are quite valuable which was not given before also there were menu cards distributed for the dinner option before take off as the crew noted down the orders previously the meals options used to be on laminated cards i had opted for the fish curry with okra and that was quite a good and filling option along with a chocolate mousse cake for dessert unfortunately due to turbulence the crew were unable to do the beverage service which was good baggage retrieval was also swift overall i feel that the soft product was markedly improved from the last time i flew them in j class including the hot towels and menu cards with greater options but with the induction of new aircraft and refurbishment of cabin interiors i am quite optimistic that the business class product could get even better in the future only issue was the delay but that was due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft,1,"['economy class', 'this flight', 'business', 'a couple', 'seats', 'a fee', 'things', 'the business class', 'the takeover', 'a good opportunity', 'a separate counter', 'business class passengers', 'the staff', 'the lounge access', 'the flight', 'the incoming flight', 'the crew', 'this fact', 'the passengers', 'the arrival', 'the flight', 'the seats', 'this airbus', 'its signs', 'ageing', 'the seat', 'newspapers  magazines', 'an upgrade', 'the soft aspects', 'the product', 'board', 'the crew', 'a welcome drink', 'a choice', 'buttermilk', 'coconut water', 'hot towels', 'menu cards', 'the dinner option', 'the crew', 'the orders', 'the meals options', 'laminated cards', 'the fish curry', 'okra', 'quite a good and filling option', 'a chocolate mousse cake', 'dessert', 'the crew', 'the beverage service', 'good baggage retrieval', 'the soft product', 'the last time', 'j class', 'the hot towels', 'cards', 'greater options', 'the induction', 'new aircraft', 'refurbishment', 'cabin interiors', 'the business class product', 'only issue', 'the delay', 'the late arrival', 'the incoming aircraft']"

july 17th i am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight when i booked my tickets i had high expectations considering that tata group had taken over air india however i was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a lowbudget airline especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like emirates or qatar airways it was quite disconcerting to find that air india which is still considered a lowcost carrier had higher prices compared to other budget airlines furthermore i would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey during checkin i had checked in baggage weighing 265 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg at no point during the checkin process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight which would have allowed me to make purchases from the dutyfree area instead i was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram this approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience to comply with the sudden weight restriction i had to rush back to the dutyfree area and drop the items i had purchased i was warned by your staff that i might face deportation if i delayed the process as a gold member of qatar airways i am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations so i complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue this incident has left a significant impact on my perception of indian airlines i now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines whether it is air india under tata ownership or any other indian carrier the flight experience itself was underwhelming with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses causing discomfort and subsequent back pain considering the recent acquisition by tata group i had hoped for a significant improvement in air indias services but unfortunately it seems that air india remains unchanged it is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines this experience has left me deeply disappointed and i feel compelled to share my concerns with you i hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience as a frequent traveler i believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort communication and transparency to build a positive reputation thank you for your attention to this matter and i sincerely hope that air india will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future,0,"['disappointing experience', 'air india', 'cochin', 'dubai', 'july 12th', 'dubai', 'cochin', 'july 17th', 'my disappointment', 'the overall experience', 'my feedback', 'the flight', 'my

AirIndia,1.0,gotten progressively worse,R Singh,2023-07-18,sometime around 2017 i got the patriotism bug after avoiding air india like a plague for years i decided to travel with air india well the first time from sfoccu and back wasn’t bad however as the years have progressed air india has gotten progressively worse yes air india seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of tata without recounting every horror story that i have about air india i will simply and briefly share my experience with air india flying back from ccu to ewr on june 30 2023 as we got to the airport i was prepared for the rudeness the staff members of indigo spice etc seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner however air india staff seemed just sad and pathetic so then we get on our flight from ccu to del the food is inedible the ac doesn’t seem to be working and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight okay so then we get to delhi now i don’t if it’s just an attitude issue perhaps something cultural in delhi or air india but air india staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent somehow i got called in for a secondary inspection apparently having a zippo without fuel is not allowed by cisf anyway so after being harassed by them i get back to the gate and the air india staff has somehow lost my boarding pass which they had kept when i went to see the cisf people instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two air india staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass finally they find it again no apology so i being exhausted get on the flight this time i had made sure to get on the flight early since on my way to kolkata they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so i had to store them in two different overhead bins so i was relieved when i saw the overhead bins empty i had booked extra legroom seats however the moment i start putting my luggage an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me i inform her that it was my seat and i will keep my luggage there she proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for oversized baggage so at this point i lose my cool so let me understand this instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight like a normal airline air india has decided to punish passengers who are following the rule anyway i told the flight attendant that i will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that she mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2 whatever however somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight as expected the inflight entertainment system did not work funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat however i regret eating the pathetic food that air india provided i kid you not the salad they gave was literally rotten didn’t they know that mayonnaise rots very easily and does not need to be warmed up what was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight at some point like a good passenger i had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner however when the attendant came she seemed agitated gestured toward the front of the flight and said you can throw it in,0,"['the patriotism bug', 'air india', 'a plague', 'years', 'air india', 'the years', 'air india', 'air india', 'the takeover', 'tata', 'every horror story', 'air india', 'my experience', 'air india', 'ccu', 'ewr', 'june', 'the airport', 'the rudeness', 'the staff members', 'indigo spice', 'their customers', 'a friendly manner', 'air india staff', 'our flight', 'ccu', 'del', 'the food', 'the ac', 'the flight attendants', 'the rest', 'the flight', 'delhi', 'n’t', 'just an attitude issue', 'air', 'india', 'air india staff', 'a secondary inspection', 'a zippo', 'fuel', 'cisf', 'the gate', 'the air india staff', 'my boarding pass', 'the cisf people', 'a pass two air india staff', 'my boarding pass', 'get', 'the flight', 'the flight', 'my way', 'kolkata', 'a space', 'my cabin luggage', 'two different overhead bins', 'the overhead bins', 'extra legroom seats', 'my luggage', 'an anxious flight attendant runs', 'my seat', 'my luggage', 'the overhead bin', 'oversized baggage', 'this point', 'the rule', 'baggage size', 'weight', 'a normal airline air india', 'passengers', 'the rule', 'the flight attendant', 'my bag', 'people', '4 bags', 'this flight attendant', 'the one', 'my seat', 'the whole 14 hour flight', 'the inflight entertainment system', 'the guy', 'his seat', 'the pathetic food', 'air india', 'not the salad', 'mayonnaise rots', 'the food', 'the same flight attendant', 'my buttons', 'the flight', 'some point', 'a good passenger', 'my trash', 'the attendant', 'dinner', 'the attendant', 'the front', 'the flight']"

AirIndia,10.0,top notch crew experience,T Sharma,2023-07-05,i had the opportunity to travel on ai flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to india i havent been adventurous enough to try them out international as ive heard my share of horror stories im going to base my review on the 2 punedelhi flights ive taken in this period booking ai fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines ai is full service which means 25 kgs of checkin luggage and meals served onboard a huge win right away online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites rating 1010 check in the checkin counter for ai literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones that did make me somewhat nervous the first time as it turns out eventually the flights both times were completely full so i have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at checkin maybe fewer flights nevertheless the checkin agent was quick efficient polite addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate i was out and about in no time  both times no complaints rating 1010 boarding boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled on both the flights i took however the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time rating 810 crew on both occasions the cabin stewards  stewardesses were polite efficient and thoroughly professional albeit the first flight they werent overly keen to smile on the second flight they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please a very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience 1010 the craft this was an older a320 not the neo version strangely there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and i had non working screen controls none of the others did i guess they reused some seats from other aircraft the seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers at 5ft7 i had decent enough knee room but the seat width  that was definitely a bonus wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer a350s and b787s that made a huge impact and i did not have to fight it out with my copassenger for rights over the arm rest of course the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics but it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting rating 710 meals dinner was served chicken korma with rice and some veggies some yoghurt and a brownie cake was decent fare served with steel cutlery thank you ai international carriers make note its criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery why do you do it the cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and i did a stress test it was actually quite rigid and strong well done service was quick and as efficient as how i was getting used to by now 810 punctuality both times on ai the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached new delhi 3035 mins ahead of schedule i repeat  3035 mins ahead of schedule on a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs this is serious wow super impressed 1010 extras throughout the trip i kept getting emails and smss from ai with status updates on departure gates and other bits and bobs of info i even got alerts for when my bags were loaded onto the aircraft who does that

AirIndia,8.0,service was quite nice,V Abbas,2023-03-05,after the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an air india flight i was cautious about flying this sector as i did not want any unforeseen surprises the fare was reasonable for this oneway flight however during checkin i was surprised to see that air india has started charging for seat selection this was never the case before as before it got privatized we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same and as air india is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this the baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems the boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board however one thing i did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board also as this was an evening flight the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea  coffee the food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side the flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice air india has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved,1,"['the last 2 experiences', 'an air india flight', 'this sector', 'any unforeseen surprises', 'the fare', 'this oneway flight', 'checkin', 'air india', 'seat selection', 'the case', 'any seat', 'our choice', 'an additional fee', 'air india', 'a full service carrier', 'the baggage drop', 'the airport', 'no problems', 'the boarding', 'time', 'the crew', 'board', 'one thing', 'the fact', 'the bus', 'almost 15 minutes', 'the staff', 'the flight', 'the previous batch', 'passengers', 'board', 'an evening flight', 'the crew', 'snack options', 'both veg', 'non veg', 'steel cutlery', 'an upgrade', 'the airline', 'only vegetarian fares', 'domestic flights', 'the veg option pav bhaji', 'a potato salad', 'the non veg option', 'chicken tikka', 'pasta', 'salad', 'tea  coffee', 'the food', 'the pasta', 'the sticky side', 'the flight', 'time', 'the crew', 'the inflight service', 'quite nice air india', 'great strides', 'the punctuality', 'their flights', 'frequencies', 'non veg', 'onboard flights', 'certain aspects', 'the ground', 'the charging', 'the seats']"

AirIndia,1.0,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Sagel Patel,2023-01-14,i recently decided to travel with air india to india and i must say i am severely disappointed and definitely will not be booking again with air india i flew on the 23rd of nov 2022 from heathrow to delhi and then delhi to ahmedabad my flight to heathrow to delhi was disappointing i paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working i told the flight attendant twice she then said she will reset the system although that didn’t work so i told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where i can sit  how can i get up and leave my seat when i’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple  why did i pay extra money for a specific seat when air india can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained secondly hygiene on these flights is horrendous i opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues there were sticky stains on the side which i wiped off with a baby wipe i would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from london but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy now i have just returned from india to heathrow with my mother again via air india and what a disappointment again flew on 1311 from ahmedabad our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots no alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 945 hours  i think you can now understand when i say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire the planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault now for the next piece of resistancé my younger sister is due to fly tomorrow i also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with air india we were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight original travel was lhr to bom and then bom to indore with a 4 hour lay over we had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover but opted to pay extra to avoid waiting so anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours no emails received about this change we received multiple about her return being changed i call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call soham who was so confusing i would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of english to your call centre staff soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled why was this not made clear in writing after a good 25 minutes soham clarified that only option is lhr to del and wait for 11 hours and then del to indore  why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes if my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money this specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting in conclusion i’m sure you can

AirIndia,3.0,dropped the ball here big time,V Agar,2023-01-02,i was booked on a waitlist flight from ccu to bom this morning which was pretty much overbooked especially in mid week which was surprising i had resigned myself to not getting any seat on the flight as it was pretty full but then at the last moment the supervisor managed to print my boarding pass and i believed that i was actually going to fly onboard the flight or so i thought after clearing the serpentine security line i rushed to the boarding gate hoping to catch my flight and that is when a big surprise was up in store for me where it was revealed by the boarding gate agents that i would be unable to board as a regular pax had taken my place this was pretty jarring especially at the last moment so i then had to make my way back to the check in desk to retrieve my luggage which had to be offloaded from the flight the point here is why was the boarding pass issued to me when there was no guarantee that i would get a seat onboard the flight if the staff had informed me that there are no seats i would have understood and resigned myself to that fact instead by printing my boarding pass it gave me a false sense of hope which was clearly not correct the purpose of me writing this review is not to bash anyone but to highlight there there are certain aspects of waitlist bookings that should be handled better here i may also have to reconsider going for waitlist bookings with the airline if this practice continues and in this regard air india dropped the ball here big time i hope that the airline takes the feedback onboard here regarding this,0,"['a waitlist flight', 'ccu', 'bom', 'mid week', 'any seat', 'the flight', 'the last moment', 'the supervisor', 'my boarding pass', 'the flight', 'the serpentine security line', 'the boarding gate', 'my flight', 'a big surprise', 'store', 'the boarding gate agents', 'a regular pax', 'my place', 'the last moment', 'my way', 'the check', 'desk', 'my luggage', 'the flight', 'the point', 'the boarding pass', 'no guarantee', 'a seat', 'the flight', 'the staff', 'no seats', 'that fact', 'my boarding pass', 'a false sense', 'hope', 'the purpose', 'this review', 'certain aspects', 'waitlist bookings', 'waitlist bookings', 'the airline', 'this practice', 'this regard air india', 'the ball', 'the airline', 'the feedback']"

AirIndia,2.0,it was a horror show,D Meares,2022-08-07,thinking of an air india flight with long stopover in delhi it was a horror show yes a 19hr stop allows for multihour delays ours was 475 late leaving sydney so they boarded us just before theyd have to give compensation to sit there if you book a hotel and organise a transit evisa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown the transit official confiscated my next boarding pass i had to argue to retrieve my bag tag which was a good thing as i suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised the delay meant id missed the last train then i couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was kafkaesque since i was already checked in no infection control wipes on the plane 2 special meals didn’t arrive entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots though i had printouts confirming my 3rd to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit xray no other airlines have this policy and mine was summarily confiscated in delhi you cant take things that fly on the aeroplane — seriously that was their rationale nice flight attendants sydney to delhi though  33 legroom was the only redeeming feature lastly unforgivably i discovered they fly right over the russian war zone that other airlines avoid whilst using russian oil bought cheaply by india sidestepping embargos french airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that a punishing 30 minute walk between so your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience,0,"['an air india flight', 'long stopover', 'a horror show', 'a 19hr stop', 'multihour delays', 'sydney', 'd', 'compensation', 'a hotel', 'a transit evisa', 'those hours', 'their bureaucracy', 'a complete meltdown', 'the transit official', 'my next boarding pass', 'my bag tag', 'a good thing', 'my bag', 'the delay', 'i', 'd', 'the last train', 'the terminal', 'departure', 'the boarding pass', 'the bureaucracy', 'a new boarding pass', 'kafkaesque', 'no infection control wipes', 'the plane 2 special meals', 'didn’t arrive entertainment', 'one side', 'the 1st plane', 'the air filter', 'the 2nd chockablock plane', 'disgusting and clueless checkin agents', 'printouts', 'things', '2nd vaccination shots', 'printouts', 'my 3rd', 'unusual items', 'drone cameras', 'your hand luggage', 'the transit xray', 'no other airlines', 'this policy', 'mine', 'things', 'the aeroplane', 'their rationale nice flight attendants sydney', '33 legroom', 'the only redeeming feature', 'the russian war zone', 'other airlines', 'russian oil', 'india sidestepping embargos french airport staff', 'the plane', 'the very last aerobridge', 'the very furthermost baggage carousel', 'a punishing 30 minute walk', 'your legs', 'a price', 'addition', 'your conscience']"

take only amex or visa card they do have few other options like net banking indian credit cards etc when you are ready to pay ai representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment  90 of the time that doesnt work with that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours so you keep on trying to pay then i put my credit card information and my india address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened my payment was accepted and here i am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company finally after all this i had a ticket to travel before the flight i updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information the website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again btw they don’t have separate line for tsa approve either on the airport it is one common line at newark airport ewr finally we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal the air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a childs meal so unfortunately we dont have an extra childs meal i am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so i convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal i had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck the flight was boeing 777 old plane which has no wifi everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working the whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system after that only 10 of the screens started working now on a 14 hour long flight you dont have wifi or screen the people who already downloaded from home are very smart in short have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight finally we made it to india and felt now everything will be fine but my misery continued while coming back from vadodara to newark as we reached vadodara airport all looks good easy going all documents verified and here i am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge the rep is saying  mam all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass did he say had written boarding pass i was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security wont let me pass the ai rep is no mam it happens sometimes and they know you please go ahead as i reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass the officer was looking at me as though i am an alien and had i issued a handwritten pass to myself ai supposed to inform airport security about this so i can have easy transition but knowing ai they didnt bother to inform the security when i said firmly that its between ai and airport security finally ai security showed up and resolved the issue,0,"['customer service', 'tons', 'patience', 'few hours', 'hand', 'the whole process', 'customer service

AirIndia,1.0,left stranded with very little options,S Kamalaya,2022-04-30,our flight route was from washington dc iad to bengaluru via delhi on 27th april ‘22 the scheduled stopover was 25 hours in which we had to complete immigration check out baggage  go through customs and recheck in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to bengaluru there was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in delhi so we had roughly only about 15 hours to complete the above steps unfortunately although we were able to finish all the required steps by 130 pm which was the scheduled departure time we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off what followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller we are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items we received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials we were exited out of the airport which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage we had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as airindia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to bengaluru the next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening we were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us we even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price 27k per ticket they’ve denied even giving that to us we were left stranded with very little options we stayed at the airport all day looking for options fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage we finally reached bengaluru around 230 am ironically this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed srinagar flight glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay i fail to understand why air india could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage in all we ended spending 70k for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours did air india sell our tickets to others what could be the reason  immigration  priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings you might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight baggage claim based on your familygroup it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out we lost a lot of time here there was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage  customs and check in luggage while checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers there should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage we lost a lot of time here security check again domestic and international passengers need to have different lines travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another

AirIndia,1.0,sublime torture on this 155 hour journey,S Shetty,2022-03-13,i have often heard of horror stories of international travel in air india but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route however due to a personal emergency i had to fly air india recently since it was the only way i could get to chicago in time air india has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 155 hour journey the tortuous checkin process with agents taking upto 1520 minutes to checkin a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board the aircraft was rundown and shabby which was the second warning but the best part was when i reached my seat i had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that i could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 45 seats had a working ife system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the air india logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway the seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests i have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that i never have to sit in this seat again this was not the end of it of course the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 245 am it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in checkin and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 56 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible after this the crew decided to rest for 67 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own teacoffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said teacoffee in perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the ife could not finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard the only redeeming factor on the flight was that air india is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight it did not alleviate the misery in any way the first thing i did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way i can put myself through such an experience again,0,"['horror stories', 'international travel', 'air india', 'the airline', 'an international route', 'a personal emergency', 'air india', 'the only way', 'chicago', 'time', 'air india', 'the art', 'a sublime torture', 'this 155 hour journey', 'the tortuous checkin process', 'agents', 'upto', '1520 minutes', 'a single passenger', 'the general chaos', 'the counter', 'delhi', 'a precursor', 'the horrors', 'board', 'the aircraft', 'the second warning', 'the best part', 'my seat', 'an exit row aisle', 'the bathroom', 'the seat', 'the the ancient inflight entertainment remote', 'my waist', 'course', 'this fun', 'the fact', 'the entire economy section', 'not more than 45 seats', 'a working ife system', 'the rest', 'the air india logo', 'the screen', '15 hours', 'complimentary headsets', 'the feel', 'the cheap headsets', 'our ears', 'the system', 'the seat', 'a worn out cushion', 'a weird back angle', 'barely usable headrests', 'an aircraft', 'this seat', 'the end', 'course', 'the airline', 'the flight', 'an ungodly hour', 'no sense', 'food', 'passengers', 'the airport', 'an awesome time', 'checkin', 'immigration', 'the mood', 'sustenance', 'some chips', 'a packet', 'cheap biscuits', 'the seat', 'breakfast', '56 hours', 'at least hunger', 'the awful food', 'the crew', '67 hours', 'a cup', 'tea', 'the galley', 'our own teacoffee', 'any cups', 'disposable paper cups', 'the said teacoffee', 'perhaps a game', 'the cup', 'the passengers', 'the ife', 'could not finally a couple', 'hours', 'dinner', 'wet cardboard', 'the only redeeming factor', 'the flight', 'air india', 'alcohol', 'good whisky', 'gin', 'good portion', 'economy', 'the end', 'the flight', 'the misery', 'any way', 'the first thing', 'my destination', 'my return ticket', 'no way', 'such an experience']"

AirIndia,1.0,customer support has been absolutely pathetic,J Kultin,2021-12-02,i flew air india on a singleleg domestic flight of less than an hour unfortunately air india lost my luggage on this flight while i understand that accidents like these happen on any airline air indias customer support has been absolutely pathetic ever since calls to generic customer support lines that can be found online either dont work or connect to someone who cannot help after waiting for long periods the specific phone numbers i received to the team handling my case at goa airport do not answer to my calls or messages even confirmed that they do answer when called from a different number so i strongly suspect them of ignoring my specific phone number at this point it has been almost two weeks since losing my bag and a week since i last managed to get through to air india despite daily attempts to do so in short this experience with customer service is extremely frustrating and having to deal with them has made my trip much worse than it had to be without luggage apart from not having much confidence in air india trying to return my luggage to me my attempts to get compensated for 1 additional expenses made for new clothing and toiletries and 2 for the value of the bag if not found after 21 days has been frustrating as well i was instructed at the airport to send my receipts to an email address specific to the goa team after which my case would get updated with them and id retrieve the compensation by picking it up in cash at any global air india office unsurprisingly i have not heard back on this email address after a week and even if the compensation would have been honored in my case the idea of having to physically go to an office after i leave india is bonkers in my many desperate attempts to get any sign of life on my case from air india the only place where they have been sort of responsive is through twitter but even they do not seem to be able to get an update from the luggage team actually handling my case concluding i would advise everyone to avoid air india at all cost as any circumstance in which youd have to deal with their customer support will be extremely frustrating while i would expect nonbudget national carriers and star alliance members offer some basic level of service this is not at all the case for air india,0,"['air india', 'a singleleg domestic flight', 'less than an hour', 'air india', 'my luggage', 'this flight', 'accidents', 'any airline air indias customer support', 'calls', 'generic customer support lines', 'long periods', 'the specific phone numbers', 'the team', 'my case', 'goa airport', 'my calls', 'messages', 'a different number', 'my specific phone number', 'this point', 'almost two weeks', 'my bag', 'air india', 'daily attempts', 'this experience', 'customer service', 'my trip', 'luggage', 'much confidence', 'air india', 'my luggage', 'my attempts', '1 additional expenses', 'new clothing', 'toiletries', 'the value', 'the bag', '21 days', 'the airport', 'my receipts', 'an email address', 'the goa team', 'my case', 'i', 'd', 'the compensation', 'cash', 'any global air india office', 'this email address', 'a week', 'the compensation', 'my case', 'the idea', 'an office', 'india', 'bonkers', 'my many desperate attempts', 'any sign', 'life', 'my case', 'air india', 'the only place', 'twitter', 'an update', 'the luggage team', 'my case', 'air india', 'at all cost', 'any circumstance', 'd', 'their customer support', 'nonbudget national carriers', 'star alliance members', 'some basic level', 'service', 'the case', 'air india']"
AirIndia,1.0,worst experience with this airline,Lilesh Karade,2021-12-02,recently i traveled with air india and experienced a worst experience with this airline we were travelling from mumbai to goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 km to terminal 2 the flight was at 9 pm and we reached at the desk at 815 pm the air india personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in it was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal later i have checked with many passengers who informed me that the airline portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal finally all the personnel to whoever i spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport and made sure that i should not board in the flight another harassment started when i went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of air india the booking officer on other side of the glasswindow was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made i kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to goa he somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls i asked him what is happening  to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets after five minutes i lost my patience and left the window secondly their call centres are closed after 1800 hrs a recorded message will be heard continuously after 1800 hrs that you are in queue but no one will respond from the other side nor the ivr facility will be available i travelled with indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable in similar situation at chandigarh airport when i reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight they made sure that i boarded in the flight with my family their personnel accompanied me from entrance of the airport up to the flight now i can understand why this airline is in losses from so many years the attitude of the staff is sinking this boat,0,"['air india', 'a worst experience', 'this airline', 'mumbai', 'goa', 'congestion', 'traffic', '2 hrs', 'a distance', '8 km', 'the flight', '9 pm', 'the desk', '815 pm', 'the air india personnel', 'the flight', 'the web check', 'the web check', 'many passengers', 'the airline portal', 'some issues', 'complete web check', 'all the personnel', 'this situation', 'my delay', 'the airport', 'the flight', 'another harassment', 'the booking office', 'the tickets', 'another flight', 'air india', 'the booking officer', 'other side', 'the glasswindow', 'my requests', 'my desire', 'a tickets', 'goa', 'my requests', 'the portal', 'five minutes', 'some phone calls', 'his superiors', 'tickets', 'five minutes', 'my patience', 'the window', 'their call centres', '1800 hrs', 'a recorded message', '1800 hrs', 'queue', 'no one', 'the other side', 'the ivr facility', 'indigo', 'the way', 'the distress', 'similar situation', 'chandigarh airport', '30 minutes', 'scheduled flight', 'the flight', 'my family', 'their personnel', 'entrance', 'the airport', 'the flight', 'this airline', 'losses', 'so many years', 'the attitude', 'the staff', 'this boat']"

AirIndia,2.0,the most disappointing experience,N Shah Jenkins,2021-12-02,i had my first experience with air india recently and i have to say it has been up there as possibly the most disappointing experience i have ever had in summary if you have a choice  please choose another proper airline this was a flight long haul from london to bombay the ticket was booked in economy and upgraded to business class using fr miles prior to flying i needed to contact customer services and this was a nightmare i wasted hours of my time trying to call them i managed to get through to one person who when i explained the problem just shouted back what’s the problem what’s the problem then he put me on hold and a different man who was more well spoken answered and then lied to me that he was going to arrange a video call back in 2h very confusing that he would say that and not try to help me and not collect any of my personal details i never did receive any support and when calling back the telephone queue was like a prank call with the queue position going up and down like a yoyo shocking beyond terrible but the worst part is those lies from customer services that really damages air india’s credibility with me anyway i went to the airport i was concerned about extra check during covid times so i arrived 35 hours before departure air india refused to allow me to check in early despite the business counter being in use by economy passengers now i know i was early so partially my fault however at one stage other bom passengers were being allowed to join the economy queue while i had to wait for be allowed to go to the business class checkin by the time i checked in there was one bom economy passenger i recognised that reached the counter before me business class is meant to be a premium product to take the hassle and stress out of travelling or add a little luxury i travel in economy for personal travel about 99 of the time as we all have bills to pay however when i upgrade to business class i expect to enjoy it and see the benefit after this ordeal i was able to enjoy at the lounge facilities at london heathrow luckily it was a star alliance lounge run by another airline phew i’m glad it wasn’t an air india lounge lest i would be subjected to further torture at the boarding gate more fun and games i’m afraid one giant mess of a queue to have temperature readings before going to the boarding desk this meant there was no discernible difference between economy and business class passengers just one big line to wait in more stress and hassle which was supposed to be avoided on the plane as expected a tired cabin outdated infotainment the seat was comfortable but lacking some adjustment options the infotainment screen was low resolution and difficult to use compared with modern equivalents on proper airlines such as etihad the business class cabin is what you would expect on a shorter haul flight such as 45h not a 9h flight i will write a complaint to air india i don’t expect to receive anything back,0,"['my first experience', 'air india', 'the most disappointing experience', 'summary', 'a choice', 'another proper airline', 'a flight long haul', 'london', 'the ticket', 'economy', 'business class', 'fr miles', 'customer services', 'a nightmare', 'hours', 'my time', 'one person', 'the problem', 'the problem', 'the problem', 'hold', 'a video call', 'my personal details', 'any support', 'the telephone queue', 'a prank call', 'the queue position', 'a yoyo', 'the worst part', 'those lies', 'customer services', 'air india’s credibility', 'the airport', 'extra check', 'covid times', 'departure air india', 'the business counter', 'use', 'economy passengers', 'my fault', 'one stage', 'other bom passengers', 'the economy queue', 'the business class checkin', 'the time', 'one bom economy passenger', 'the counter', 'me business class', 'a premium product', 'the hassle', 'a little luxury', 'economy', 'personal travel', 'the time', 'bills', 'business class', 'the benefit', 'this ordeal', 'the lounge facilities', 'london heathrow', 'a star alliance lounge', 'another airline', 'an air india lounge', 'further torture', 'the boarding gate', 'and games', 'one giant mess', 'a queue', 'temperature readings', 'the boarding desk', 'no discernible difference', 'economy and business class passengers', 'just one big line', 'more stress', 'hassle', 'the plane', 'a tired cabin', 'the seat', 'some adjustment options', 'the infotainment screen', 'low resolution', 'modern equivalents', 'proper airlines', 'the business class cabin', 'a shorter haul flight', '45h', 'a 9h flight', 'a complaint', 'air india']"

IndiGo,1.0,management should be truly be ashamed,M Keele,2022-12-11,so i tried to heed the many warnings that i saw in this airlines terrible reviews regarding their baggage scam policy i recently had a flight from mumbai to maldives for which the ticket fare was 159 for a oneway ticket still a little pricey but not bad the only reason why i took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the maldives after booking the ticket i noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance my initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight but im sure i can purchase a bag just in case the week of the flight i spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options one problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling at 48 hours i started the attempt to add a bag the website is not userfriendly when it comes to adding bags when you click on the add bags button it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now neither of these buttons work i tried on safari chrome and also my mobile nada the day before the flight i spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it on my mobile i was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight but only 5 kilos you click on that button and the screen goes blank long story short i had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag i finally found the loophole when you go to 6e addons where the add baggage should be but isnt and just click on anything that is listed it will take you to the addon page and then there it is add a bag more confusion sets in because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees 22 usd i thought perfect one catch i didnt see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on all the other airline websites out there the morning of the flight i saw my bags were still a little too heavy so i added an extra 5 kilos which was 40 for just 5 kilos yes 40 for just 5 kilos i get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos guy said that my bags were too heavy i was so confused i tried what i could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway come to find out you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos total doesnt say total on the website so you have to pay 22 extra for the same exact weight but for an additional bag what the ever living that makes no sense you pay extra for a bag but actually get less weight because the additional bag will also add weight so you have to pack less items what a disaster i ended up having to pay 162 in baggage fees for my 159 flight how the government allows this i have no clue i saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery good description but more like extortion i also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling you have been warned do not use this airline hopefully one day a reputable airline like vistara which was great will buy this company out and change things around for the good because the current management should be truly be ashamed and if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight it was a normal size plane probably more to the larger size there is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is greed

IndiGo,9.0,could not have asked for anything better,S Vanush,2022-02-27,we had to go indore for a family function and on this particular flight we had checked in online and as the fare booked was a corporate fare the seat selection was free at bangalore airport there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access this is also something i experienced first hand and was very valuable the boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage i selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time the food was pretty decent along with the tea staff service was prompt and polite arrival was 30 mins ahead of schedule which was appreciated and the crew was wearing a smile on their faces even while deboarding and thanking the passengers overall could not have asked for anything better,1,"['a family function', 'this particular flight', 'the fare', 'a corporate fare', 'the seat selection', 'bangalore airport', 'a separate section', 'the passengers', 'their bags', 'the staff', 'the bags', 'a much faster process', 'other airlines', 'order', 'the waiting time', 'queues', 'also another point', 'the kiosk machines', 'the boarding', 'the mobile boarding pass', 'the mobile phones', 'security access', 'first hand', 'the boarding', 'schedule', 'the flight', 'the booking', 'a corporate booking', 'a single meal', 'a beverage', 'the paneer masala rice', 'the afternoon time', 'the food', 'the tea staff service', 'prompt and polite arrival', '30 mins', 'schedule', 'the crew', 'a smile', 'their faces', 'the passengers']"

IndiGo,4.0,comfort might be a difficulty,V Andrews,2017-08-12,  delhi to mumbai on indigo airbus a321 had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online we went to the airport directly however it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks this issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline the flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure the seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame then comfort might be a difficulty as this is a low cost carrier meals and snacks such as sandwiches both veg and nonvegetarian teacoffee and cup noodles were offered as i had booked this flight with a corporate meal a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff the sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can after the snack unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result it got even more cramped to be fair to the crew they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers the positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency on the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem their inflight magazine hello 6e had some articles but was by and large an inshop magazine would i fly with them again maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead,0,"['indigo airbus', 'a321', 'this evening flight', 'the airport', 'a copy', 'the boarding pass', 'the check', 'kiosks', 'the online boarding passes', 'any need', 'the printout', 'the kiosks', 'this issue', 'my previous flight', 'another airline', 'the flight', 'time', 'just a slight 10 minute delay', 'departure', 'the seats', 'a slightly bigger frame', 'comfort', 'a difficulty', 'a low cost carrier meals', 'snacks', 'sandwiches', 'both veg', 'nonvegetarian teacoffee', 'cup noodles', 'this flight', 'a corporate meal', 'a chicken sandwich', 'juice', 'takeoff', 'the sandwich', 'the colder side', 'the juice', 'a can', 'the snack', 'the passenger', 'front', 'his seat', 'a result', 'the crew', 'their tasks', 'great efficiency flight', 'time', 'the aircraft', 'the crew', 'the passengers', 'the crews friendly attitude', 'efficiency', 'the downside', 'a bigger frame', 'the conditions', 'longer flights', 'a problem', 'their inflight magazine', '6e', 'some articles', 'an inshop magazine', 'very short routes', 'dirt', 'the full service carriers']"

SpiceJet,5.0,a decent functional experience,S Harshun,2023-11-01,i had taken this evening flight to calcutta during the web checkin i had opted for the random seat selection for which there would be no charges applied as i was travelling solo so before 12 hours of the departure i had received the seat checkin was done at the old t1 terminal at bom where baggage drop was done swiftly as there was no line and queues which was surprising the boarding started on time however i noticed that when i was about to greet the crew there were 2 crew members who were not really greeting any of the passengers and seem surprised that i wished them good evening when they reciprocated ideally greeting the passengers is something that should be standard also i noticed that the load on this flight was on the lighter side as well however due to the atc clearances the actual pushback and departure was delayed by over 1 hour but this was not on the airline the pilots did a good job of keeping the passengers updated about the reasons for the delay the flight itself was operated on one of those boeing 737800ng aircraft that was painted in the erstwhile jetconnect liveries the pilots tried to make the time en route on the flight and was able to retrieve my luggage soon without waiting too long while spicejet has been going through a lot of difficulties in recent times and that was also reflected in the manner in which the crew seemed disinterested in greeting the passengers there are still small things that the airline can do which can still make a small difference to the passenger experience because otherwise for the fare that was paid this was a decent functional experience that was able to get me safely to my destination,1,"['this evening flight', 'the web checkin', 'the random seat selection', 'no charges', '12 hours', 'the departure', 'the seat checkin', 'the old t1 terminal', 'bom', 'baggage drop', 'no line', 'queues', 'the boarding', 'time', 'the crew', '2 crew members', 'the passengers', 'the passengers', 'the load', 'this flight', 'the lighter side', 'the atc clearances', 'the actual pushback', 'departure', 'over 1 hour', 'the airline', 'the pilots', 'a good job', 'the passengers', 'the reasons', 'the delay', 'the flight', 'those boeing 737800ng aircraft', 'the erstwhile', 'jetconnect liveries', 'the pilots', 'the time', 'route', 'the flight', 'my luggage', 'spicejet', 'a lot', 'difficulties', 'recent times', 'the manner', 'the crew', 'the passengers', 'small things', 'the airline', 'a small difference', 'the passenger experience', 'the fare', 'a decent functional experience', 'my destination']"
