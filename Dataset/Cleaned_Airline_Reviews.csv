AirIndia,8.0,for the price paid flight was pretty good,T Reddy,2024-09-26,it seems that on the early morning departure from bom to ccu they have upgraded their aircraft from the a320 to the a321 which resulted in additional seating and so i was able to get a seat onboard this flight departure was on time and for breakfast had opted for the omelet with hash browns which was good the crew were quite nice during this flight and landing into calcutta was timely for the price paid the flight was pretty good,1
AirIndia,1.0,the experience was extremely poor,Joshua Heath,2024-09-26,i flew from sydney to delhi on flight ai301 and the experience was extremely poor unacceptable service from the onboard crew throughout the flight before take off a ground crew member came onboard to inform me the entertainment system at my seat was not working i was given the following 3 options option 1 they would try and get me on a flight the next day i was traveling for business with multiple meetings booked for my arrival in delhi which could not be changed i declined this offer option 2 downgrade to economy i declined this offer option 3 sign a form giving me rs 10000 credit approximately 180aud i accepted this offer however considering my flight was 12 hours with no entertainment the compensation offered was extremely disappointing inadequate and not reflective of the situation i was faced with the most shocking part of the flight which was completely inappropriate were the crew members that took their sleep breaks in seat e  f of row 1 business class seats in total i counted 6 different crew taking their sleep breaks for around 45min  1hour with some even changing into sleepwear absolutely appalling i did not pay a full business class fare to be seated in a crew rest area unexceptionable and disgraceful at what stage of air travel did crew sleep in passenger seats let alone in business class throughout my flight it was exceedingly difficult to get a crew members attention even after pressing my call button crew would walk straight pass my seat which i witnessed this among other passengers as well i had to get up from me seat twice during my flight to go and ask a crew member in the galley for assistance non of the crew were helpful or polite and i was made to feel like i was an inconvenience to their journey i contact air india via email following my flight regarding the crew taking their rest breaks in the business class cabin astonishingly i was informed that crew are permitted to rest in vacant seats so unless you want to sit next to the crew taking it their rest breaks i recommend avoiding air india,0
AirIndia,1.0,incompetence of this airline,Alex Simion,2024-09-26,had a flight on 31 august from bangalore to paris with a stop in delhi although the connection was 3h appart and the air india personell assured me that the baggage will be forwarded in delhi hey did not manage to do that i am now 24 days latter after 10s of calls and several tickets opened still not in the possesion of my luggage air india knows nothing all they suggest is rasing another ticket as the others i already have are closed not that anyone even contacted me once to tell me something the sheer incompetence of this airline is incredible i will take a moment here also to speak about the flight itself aircraft dirty not a little dirty but dirty in a gross way like it was cleaned the last time a few years ago entertainment wise 50 of all screens in the aircraft were not working the ones that did had headphones issues the perfect environment to spend 9h this was the last time that i will buy a ticket from them and i really advice everyone else to not look at a couple of dollars difference and save yourselves hours of headaches customer support is inexistant they answer they barely speak english and all that they do is open tickets that they close themselves probably to look good in statistics as none of my tickets got any answer or at least an automatic email saying that your ticket is closed you just wait like an idiot and nothing happens,0
AirIndia,1.0,disappointed in air india service,Mahesh Sharma,2024-09-26,the worst experience when i decided to book tickets for my father with air india i choose the hassle free itinerary so that he doesnt have to check in the baggage two times but the opposite happened while booking the ticket the airline hid the information about baggage self transfer in the transit and i confirmed with their costumer service agent two times that if the connected flight will have automatic baggage check in or else and both time i got the answer that this is same airline in both flights so it is automatically transfer baggage service so i was relieved but at delhi airport my father was told to take the baggage and self check in again and he was confused and called me to confirm as of my surprise i called the air india customer support which was of no help obviously finally my father who is almost 65 years has to self check in the baggage i am utterly disappointed in air india service as one of the reasons i choose air india because the transit would be smooth but it was the worst,0

AirIndia,2.0,i have asked for compensation,P Hashel,2024-09-11,while booking we had booked flexi ticket for my mother from london to heathrow on 7 september 2024 she is 62 yrs old and was feeling slightly nauseated so i pre selected her seat for 17 c in economy by web check in paying 42 pounds extra before boarding she was told that her seat is upgraded to 5 a in business class as she has high value ticket during booking after boarding in 5 a seat ground staff came inside the flight and asked her to shift to 18 c economy by providing a new boarding pass it was near to lavatory already she was feeling nauseating so she asked details of why it is changed after seating in seat she was told this changes happen and she was denied to even seat on her originally booked ticket of 17 c economy  and ultimately she had to seat at a broken seat 10 k in business class to avoid nausea and seat next to lavatory it was basically a selection between backache due to broken seat and nausea due to close to lavatory cabin crew rajkumar and dimpy went out of their way to make her feel comfortable but she developed backache after seating in broken seat and crew of flight told to complain against the ground staff lady we understand it is management and cabin crew right to allow seating but this is not the way of treating a elderly lady for no fault of hers its a recent event and i have asked for compensation lets hope it doesnt fall on deaf ears like others,0
AirIndia,1.0,18 hour delay,Jean-Claude Albrecht,2024-09-11,18 hour delay in reaching my destination extremely poor management of flight delay in london despite 6 hour delay in leaving london and anticipated missed connexon air india insisted that we board the flight to delhi to avoid transferring to another airline then transit passengers had to fight for themselves to obtain a transfer many hours later also no entertainment during flight to delhi broken seat just to name a few additional issues i have requested compensation from air india as i am entitled no news so far but i will fight to get what i am entitled for 520 gbp,0
AirIndia,2.0,annoying frustrating and sad experience ,J Vogelmann,2024-09-11,annoying frustrating and sad experience i wont repeat no idea how this airline can be part of star alliance with their standard being so far behind almost all entertainment screens were broken  dirty floor and seats with stains  no water or toilet paper in the toilets  horrible food especially for people who cant handle spicy or lentils well  seats in a320 ridiculously close to each other got constantly slammed by the guy in front of me this felt even worse than ryanair but theyre at least cheap also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight  security at delhi airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but lets you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance i have no understanding for this behaviour at all security also was unfriendly and arrogant absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change 360€ for 1 day later might be like this with other carriers as well but i dont like it actually the only good thing i can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while air france klm lufthansa  try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines i will avoid both indian airports and air india in the future that was by far the lowest standard i have ever experienced by an airline flying to europe,0
AirIndia,1.0,ancient angled flat seat,Dilip Kumar,2024-09-11,we booked lie flat seats with the new air india airplanes ai 183 from del to sfo but they changed to an old airplane with an ancient angled flat seat which should not even be premium economy they also refused to change to a different flight or upgrade the class of travel claiming very high change fees  even though i had paid 4214 per person this is inspite of me having knee surgery last year making travel hard for me would definitely avoid at all cost  new management has not made them change their ways,0

AirIndia,7.0,crew were quite nice and friendly,N Hashun,2024-09-11,on this flight noticed that in recent times the aircraft was upgraded from an a320 to a321 which resulted in having more seats in y class boarding started on time however there was a slight delay in takeoff for breakfast went with the veg option that had some parathas to eat along with some potatoes which was fine the crew were quite nice and friendly here and we landed on time in mumbai overall for the price paid and the fact that travel was over a weekend there were seats available thankfully which made it all the more easier,1
AirIndia,2.0,seats wont recline and handles broken,Chandan Prakash,2024-09-11,travelled from lhr to delhi in august 2024 flight tickets were costly even higher than ba or virgins ticket price two adults and two children were flying what we got an old aircraft with no inflight entertainment system no charging points seats wont recline and handles broken only good thing was that there was a decent leg room space staff behaviour was as one would expect in the economy class when i complained i was told that a new a350 is being procured but how does that help me in a really expensive flight on that day where the 9 hour flight seemed to take forever to reach delhi in this age asking about wifi availability felt as if i came from the moon the quantity of food has been reduced so much now that i have started carrying my own,0

AirIndia,1.0,embarrassing and unacceptable,R Maltin,2024-09-11,this is a review and complaint for flight ai 301 departing sydney to london via delhi on 03 jul 24 appalling none of the tvs worked for the duration of my 24 hours flight  two flights two aircraft this was my second flight with air india the return leg of a prebooked ticket and the second time this has happened to me no tvs  no entertainment so there was no excuse this time round i flew over 30 hours from sydney to london via 12 hours layover in delhi this is unacceptable on top of that the toilets were disgusting smelly unkempt eg sticky floors and insecure  the bored flight attendants had a common habit of banging on the doors whilst in use and opening them from the outside even when they were in use and there was no queue of people waiting to use them ambushed on the loo this humiliating experience happened to me three times on one flight it was embarrassing and unacceptable avoid this airline if at all possible,0
AirIndia,5.0,air india still has lot of work to do,N Vankash,2024-08-27,on 10th july i boarded air india flight ai540 from chennai t4 to delhi t3 for returning to my college there was no issue while boarding the flight as both the ground crew as well the cabin crew were very kind and responsive but the main issue began in the aircraft where my seat 17f a window seat had a broken handle and a loose tray table which in my opinion would have come off with a slight increase in force apart from this the aircraft had a bad odor which made me uncomfortable for the rest of the flight i faced no issue and the food was good along with the cheerful cabin crew but my bad opinion on air india further increased when the flight landed in delhi it took almost 3040 mins of waiting in the aircraft just to deplane after the plane came to a complete stop because of improper communication which lead to a lot of unrest among the passengers leading to a chaotic deplaning experience finally i say that air india still has lot of work to do especially in terms of aircraft maintenance and proper coordination with ground services,0

AirIndia,2.0,get your act together,C Ranaja,2024-08-27,if air india has such lousy inflight entertainment usually the entire system doesnt work or when it does it offers little in terms of options then they at least need to have phonetablet charging outlets on longhaul flights so people can keep their devices charged in order to watch content they downloaded beforehand its a nobrainer get your act together air india,0

AirIndia,1.0,please avoid air india,Manju Chandran,2024-05-17,torontodelhi on may 3 2024 business class worst experience ever from the flag carrier airline of india business class looks like premium economy of other airlines foot rest was stuck separation between 2 adjacent seats was for namesake never able to put it properly once boarded we were served a vegetarian roll said they are having catering issues and only boxed items are available no notification regarding same was given to us until boarded the flight later came food in boxes with vistara label a sandwich haldiram packet chocolate granola bar vistara label is indicative that the airline was aware of the issue earlier why passengers were not notified either by emailsms no beverages were served had to ask for a coffee also had to ask the hostess to have the cup removed after 45 min lacking basic standards of customer service towards the end of trip head of crew came to apologize for the catering issue return trip on 512 was in economy class no blankets were provided at seat audiovisual system never worked should say there was food agents at gate were literally looting travellers by weighing cabin and personal baggage and charging for items bought from duty paid stop they had the most arrogant answers for questions or complaints anyone travelling is doing it as it may be an emergency trip and cannot find tickets else were given a chance please avoid air india,0
AirIndia,1.0,pathetic service and attitude,Sreejith Pillai,2024-05-17,booked in business and such a pathetic service and attitude of the crew they didn’t have food in business as they had issues with catering and they knew it before they left india all the business class passengers were handed out a box lunch which had vistara label the vistara label on the box indicate that they had prior knowledge about the catering issue and contained a soggy veg sandwich a chocolate and cookie for a 15 hr nonstop flight the crew’s attitude was even embarrassing and no one even bothered to take the coffee cup back and it was done after a request was made and it took them 90 minutes to take the cup not sure what the airline is up to and is a shame for star alliance in general will never fly again,0
AirIndia,1.0,poor management and bad decisions,O Shaw,2024-05-17,the airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more when the tatas took over people had high hope for its recovery however even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse i avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless i have no better options its a big let down for a tata company i do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as air india is now i also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top campbell wilson this guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for economy passengers this guy says this is in line with the industry trend well i dont think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines even japan airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights so what is the difference between ai and the other budget airlines offering the same 15 kgs in my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my inbound flight from tokyo i called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore i wish to cancel i was told that i can cancel but there will be no refund i have never had issues with their star alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and i get a full refund in case of cancellation not only star alliance but numerous airlines with one world and sky team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit obviously this is another similarity with budget airlines i definitely cannot recommend this airline in its current avatar unless there is a drastic change which i do not see happening any time soon definitely not under a ceo who is trying to run it as a budget airline i also understand that the airline is currently at a loss however with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty,0
AirIndia,1.0, disaster from start to finish,R Parjun,2024-05-17,my recent experience with air india on a longhaul flight from melbourne to hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare from start to finish the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied  the food served was not only of poor quality but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing to add insult to injury the taste was abysmal and the quality of desserts was subpar failing to meet even the most basic expectations moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself the state of the toilets was deplorable broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers its unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions furthermore the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age with technology readily available theres no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity especially during a lengthy 20hour flight speaking of discomfort the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless and if the inflight experience wasnt bad enough the ordeal continued upon arrival at delhi airport the mishandling of baggage collection with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings in conclusion my experience with air india was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish the combination of poor food quality unsanitary conditions lack of entertainment uncomfortable seating and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again its truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards and i urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering air india for their travels,0
AirIndia,1.0,worst experience i’ve had,Chris Dangelo,2024-05-17,this is the worst experience i’ve had flying internationally on the first leg the recline was broken on the second leg the inflight entertainment remote was taped to the armrest because it too was broken there is one little usb to try and charge gadgets not robust enough for my laptop oh and the recline didn’t work either for fifteen hours regardless the economy seat backs are about 2 inches of hard plastic coated in musty fabric zero padding to be found for fifteen hours the extra 1 of legroom when compared to us carries doesn’t add much to the experience i’ve got to say this is the most rundown disgusting cabin and up there with one of the more miserable flying experiences i’ve had find another airline it will be worth it,0
AirIndia,1.0,3 toilets out of order,S Ram,2024-05-17,nonstop flight to del from sfo 15hrs 45 minutes had 3 toilets out of order inflight entertainment was broken in 75 or more of the seats individual reading lights were also not working seatback trays on which you place food was cracking my theory is that indian crew possibly prefers janitors back in india to clean toilets and so possibly locks them as out of order if clogged or dirty,0
AirIndia,2.0,not the customer service we expect,Aniruddha Agnihotri,2024-05-17,we have booked for premium economy class when we were doing online checkin 48 hrs before the flight we could not get a reserved seat in premium economy we thought that it may be a system error but when went to the airport counter air india personnel said that the flight did not have premium economy also the attendant was very rude even if they knew it a couple of days before they did not intimated it to us we are still waiting for the reimbursement of this change from air india this is not the customer service we expect,0
AirIndia,2.0,terrible customer service experience,Shivani Bhandari,2024-05-17,i had a terrible customer service experience with the ground staff they were very rude and uncooperative lacking basic manners it seemed like they didn’t care when i asked for the complaints procedure and policy as no one was aware of it after insisting they provided a complaint book with no explanation of the procedure,0

AirIndia,2.0,no in flight entertainment,Sam Reed,2024-04-29,i will not fly air india both legs of my flight had no in flight entertainment so 15 hours each way my big issue is how they charge for bags being over weight they generously give free checked bags but they weighed my carry ons boarding the flight and said i had to pay over 10000 rupees to board as my bags were over weight how greedy and petty,0
AirIndia,8.0,overall a good flight,N Harsun,2024-04-29,for this early morning flight i had opted to show up on the weekend hoping that the load on this flight would not be as full as they normally would be over the weekends the check in supervisor was kind and thankfully there were couple of seats available where i could get a seat onboard the boarding started on time and the crew onboard was pretty friendly for breakfast had opted for the egg omelet with hash browns which was fine along with tea arrival into ccu was also good and timely baggage retrieval was also good overall a good flight,1
AirIndia,7.0,air india customer review,Alok Mishra,2024-04-29,check in smooth staff at cdg airport paris were cooperative boarding smooth and easy crew average not as pleasing as i would expect from india needs to improve to make the travellers feel cared meal too hot to my taste  desserts were of poor quality ife touch screen was not working no wifi onboard meal didnt fully match the menu provided on air india mobile app smooth transfer at delhi,1
AirIndia,1.0,nothing short of a nightmare,Maya Koren Kofman,2024-04-29,air india a nightmare of unresponsive customer service dealing with air india has been nothing short of a nightmare while they did answer my initial calls their promise of a callback was nothing but empty words leaving me stranded without assistance after over ten phone calls and spending more than ten hours on hold they finally claimed to have found a flight for me and confirmed the booking however it turned out to be a lie they falsely claimed that el al had canceled their part of the flight when in reality they hadnt this deceitful behavior only added to the frustration of the situation their failure to provide an alternative flight after canceling mine as required by law further compounded the issue despite repeated attempts to seek help i was met with indifference and a lack of solutions air indias customer service is simply unacceptable save yourself the hassle and choose an airline that values its customers,0
AirIndia,1.0,ridiculous customer service,S Furman,2024-04-29,absolutely ridiculous customer service never fly air india after they canceled my flight and provided me with an unsuitable solution on a different day they also had a gut to demand money because of fare differences and when i didnt agree and wanted to speak with somebody senior they disconnected my call better go for a proper low cost at least you know what to expect,0
AirIndia,1.0,no working entertainment,Sallie Palanivel,2024-04-29,absolutely pathetic no working entertainment or even a working overhead light for a 9 hour flight only vodka or whiskey to drink no diet coke cabin crew ok the first and last time i ever use air india,0
AirIndia,7.0,a pretty routine flight,H Varsun,2024-04-29,for this late afternoon flight the boarding started on time and for snacks option there was chhole kulche along with dessert and teacoffee for the non veg option there was chicken with noodles the flight itself was pretty uneventful and landed at blr on time but noted that the baggage took a bit of time to arrive at the carousel but otherwise for the price that was paid this was a pretty routine flight,1
AirIndia,9.0,the flight was quite nice,H Varsun,2024-04-29,i opted for this midweek flight hoping there would be enough seats which at the check in thankfully there was the staff supervisor there was very friendly and helped me when my boarding pass was unable to get scanned at the security at blrs t2 gate she assisted me in getting through the security and also dealing with some passengers who were in front of me during check in the flight was quite nice that had dinner service on board had opted for the chicken dish that came along with rice and stuff parathas which was good arrival was on time and so was baggage retrieval ,1
AirIndia,3.0,seat back was in a catastrophic state,N Marten,2024-04-29,how do you feel when the pilot makes an announcement shortly after the plane has started taxiing and points out a technical problem with the air conditioning that will hopefully be solved during the flight well more than uncertain when we boarded the plane the cabin was heated to around 35° which remained the case for the first 15 hours or so of the flight  the seatbelt indicator lights did not work either this perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft while the entertainment system at my wifes seat didnt work on the outward flight it practically failed throughout the entire plane on the return flight and that on a longhaul flight in addition one toilet didnt work my seat back was in a catastrophic state and one toilet was out of order in another the washbasin was provisionally glued down so that it didnt fall off the wall do you feel comfortable and safe a clear no its also cheeky when checking in online 48 hours before departure the seats are displayed our two seats offered at no extra cost were in different rows if we wanted to sit together or enjoy a bit more legroom we had to pay extra coincidentally relatives of ours were flying from frankfurt to singapore the same week here too the decision was made no more air india after a lengthy back and forth with air india we were granted around 120 euros in compensation for both passengers with a total flight price of almost 1800 euros this was an outrage,0

AirIndia,3.0,not in any way attentive,Richard Samra,2024-04-11,in march of 2024 i flew multiple international and domestic india flights with air india all flights were sold as business class the delhi to sfo plane was old my seat was neither comfortable and the controls did not work the food was pathetic and to top it off the flight attendants were not in any way attentive requests for food or drinks were either ignored or required two or three requests and up to a fifty minute wait time the flight attendants were either not properly trained over worked or simply did not care about passengers nothing one expects to be found in business class was apparent with air india in fact in my experience most domestic united states carriers premium economy far surpass anything i experienced with air india business class on an international flight,0
AirIndia,8.0,overall had a good experience,V Harsun,2024-04-11,i was travelling on the morning flight from ccu to bom and had bought this ticket at a discount rate and even though the flight was on the fuller side i was able to get through boarding started a bit late and we were in the aircraft for almost an hour due to the atc congestion for breakfast had opted for the veg option that included parathas with sabzi a croissant along with yogurt and beverages landing was on time and baggage retrieval was swift overall had a good experience for the price that was paid,1

AirIndia,2.0,disheartening to see such discrepancies,S Lansali,2024-04-11,i recently traveled business class from london to mumbai throughout the journey i observed a significant disparity between the two sides of the plane on one side passengers were promptly served snacks juice and amenities kits while the other side seemed to receive less attention as a paying business class traveler this inconsistency was quite evident and left me perplexed whenever i requested assistance from the flight attendants their standard reply was we’ll take care of it for your side later unfortunately these assurances rarely translated into action whether it was headphones desserts or other amenities the promised items often failed to materialize strongly urge the management to implement better checks and balances keeping track of items served to each passenger is essential after all we all paid for the same business class experience and it’s disheartening to see such discrepancies,0

AirIndia,1.0,unprofessional and uncooperative,B Paneyas,2024-03-16,i check in into terminal 2 of airport properly as per ticket so not only me but along with me several families were misguided to go to gate 6 and 7 after we enter the gate there is no representative of air india to guide us people were late on top of it security gate delay and than no one responsible person the staff tells us this is domestic counter you go to international and no body of their staff knows where is this international counter all clueless people ok after that people some how reach the international counter the moment we go 5 to 10 mins before the reporting time their staff informs the flight is closed and youll will have to go to managers they give us big lecture on time and all so we told them we were already there on time your staff misguided us on wrong gate they are very very good at telling you your duties but they are unprofessional and uncooperative people,0
AirIndia,1.0,air india lost my luggage,Gulmira Chamoli,2024-03-16,the worst airline in the world i was traveling from dubai to delhi and air india lost my luggage first they said dubai didn’t send which was a lie because dubai airport sent on same day after they was telling me we don’t know where is your luggage,0

AirIndia,8.0,good decent service,Kishor Bhattarai,2024-03-16,i have been helped by the reviews here so decided to share my experience from washington dc to kathmandu via delhi flight timeduration and price was just too tempting to give ai a try and i am glad i tried them i find their economy seats comfortable and good decent service however restrooms cleanliness can be improved i did not care about entertainment system so no comment on that hope air india keeps improving i will fly with them again,0

AirIndia,1.0,extremely dissatisfied with air india,G Halat,2024-03-03,i am extremely dissatisfied with air india despite my family repeatedly warning me not to travel with ai i thought of giving it a try on my way from del to lhr  my inflight entertainment did not work this has been such a common complaint from my relatives hence they warned me i pressed the call attendant button but they would just turn off the sign i pressed the button 4 times and on all 4 occasions they turned off the sign from their end frustrated i went to cabin crew area where they were just talking i dont have any issues with them laughing and talking  it is their right my problem is why they kept turning off the help calls i explained that the inflight entertainment did not work they asked me to sit 5 mins later a lady came and said its a common issue and the fact that the flight is around 8 hours i could sleep during this time i told her yes i would sleep but no one should be commanding what time i do what she said maybe i can give feedback as none of air india inflight entertainment systems work in any plane,0
AirIndia,1.0,i asked for compensation,Sven Olsson,2024-03-03,the airline is part of the star alliance but is not an airline that lives up to the normal standard the plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment but the majority of the screens were not working might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem please prepare to have your own entertainment with you the food onboard was really bad normally i like the kind of food served in india but this was really bad take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by air india the plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good i would warn you for the not so pleasant flight service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good i only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits my travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours when i asked for compensation of 600 euros not for a full refund they changed the delay cause to bad weather and not technical issues,0
AirIndia,1.0,it’s a bad experience,Simran Singh,2024-03-03,it’s a bad experience the flight timing was 2240pm on 11th feb from mumbai to abu dhabi but they changed timing as 1230 on 12th feb 140am and then 2am but still not sure when they will depart it’s so disappointing and for the delayed refreshment they are not proving any coffe or tea and providing only specific meal with smallest water bottle,0

AirIndia,1.0,our worst flying experience,D Haysan,2024-03-03,our worst flying experience my wife and i were flying air india from ahmedabad to newark via mumbai our first flight was delayed from 825 pm to 925pm and we were informed just a few hours before after arriving at the airport we were told that our connecting flight form mumbai to newark has been cancelled and that we would have to fly to jfk in ny instead we insisted that we would prefer to fly to newark but no one could guarantee us a seat to newark even a few days later we were told no flight could be seen in the near future and that we should take the flight to jfk well the flight from ahmedabad was not delayed by an hour it did not depart for another hour and a half  11 pm by then we had been at the airport for 5 hours but no one offered us any food vouchers or water after arriving in mumbai we had a heck of a time getting to the gate due to the distance and security check etc the flight to jfk was scheduled at 145 am and we were sure we couldn’t make that even worse than that is the fact that while we were trying to reach our gate we heard an announcement for an air india flight leaving for newark we were lied to about the newark flight being cancelled and bumped onto another flight which reaches at an airport that is another hour away form newark we did not receive any prior notification as with the first flight but were surprised at the checkin counter meanwhile the flight to jfk was delayed by a little over an hour and finally left at 300 am with us on it we had to make other arrangements to get home and it cost us more money there was no talk of any compensation for inconvenience or any other options by air india,0

AirIndia,1.0,a very bad experience,Akshay Jain,2024-02-02,a very bad experience it was a 125 hr flight from delhi to sydney supposed to take off at 215pm on 13th jan from delhi firstly i reach the check in counter at 1145 am and stood in the queue there are so many counters for air india but any counter is not for a particular air india flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for sydney or dubai or london or xyz destination secondly there were so long queue that by the time i reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by so finally at 1pm i reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop while the staff was checking my flight details i just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 430 pm instead of 215 pm  then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 430pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in so which means i had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs after that i have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage what a waste of time 1hr later at roughly around 215 pm i went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information finally i did a baggage drop and went further for a security check after security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm i still had another 1 hr with nothing to do i had thought i will be in flight already 215 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either slowly some time passed by and at 345 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 530 take off this meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off then at 445 finally they started the boarding so finally i had some relief and thought ok no more delays now  almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 515 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight 10 minutes the passenger finally came the flight finally started a take off at 545 pm after all this once the flight was in the air around 615 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time finally at 645 they provided snacks and drinks  also from the time i sat in the plan the tv was not working at all i informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food they started serving food at 645 pm and finished by 745 pm  i told then again about the tv and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up so i thought probably by 815 at least i should be able to watch something  once the reset was completed and i turned on the tv but still it was not fixed basically i had to stay for the entire 13 hrs flight without tv i had no option left but go to sleep first long wait for check in  second flight delayed by 3 hrs and third no tv,0

AirIndia,2.0,experience with air india was challenging,Bhawana Thaker,2023-12-05,my experience with air india was challenging due to the itinerary and service encountered during the journey the flights had extended layovers – a 45 hour stopover in delhi on the way to hyderabad and an 11hour stopover in mumbai on the return journey to new jersey this lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression regarding the inflight service it was satisfactory although the food served from mumbai to ewr lacked authenticity and didnt meet expectations at delhi airport i was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure however there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering which affected the overall ambiance on the other hand mumbai airport was extremely crowded and i faced challenges with uncooperative staff despite my longhaul flight 11hour stopover and having a sick child with me both immigration officers and air india staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance their lack of empathy was evident with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting i try my luck with immigration this was a disappointing and rude response i strongly urge air indias customerfacing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness as a business class passenger enduring an 11hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience i rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with air india staff at mumbai airport such attitudes are unacceptable when dealing with customers who expect better service standards,0

AirIndia,1.0,a very humiliating experience,C Cherry Modi Saraogi,2023-11-21,casually denied my seat at the counter due to overbooking then manager seeing i am a single lady flying tries to show his power and raise voice at me air india is pathetic such cruel customer services will not be accepted they dont care about the customer such an arrogant man thinks that just because he is sitting behind desk and has a mere ticket he can do anything say anything black mail someone in any manner such behaviour will never be acceptable i had a very humiliating experience with this airline,0
AirIndia,8.0,the soft product was markedly improved,V Reddy,2023-11-21,i had booked initially on economy class for this flight but was able to upgrade to business as there were a couple of seats available which came at a fee and i really wanted to see how things have changed especially on the business class after the takeover so thought this was a good opportunity there is a separate counter for business class passengers where the staff was able to courteously check in and provide the lounge access voucher as well the flight was delayed as the incoming flight was delayed and the crew were able to proactively communicate this fact to the passengers including the arrival of the flight which was good it seems that even though the seats are quite spacious this airbus 321 was also showing its signs of ageing as well the seat also had newspapers  magazines which once could read but there was definitely an upgrade of the soft aspects of the product on board the crew were welcoming and as a welcome drink there was a choice between buttermilk and coconut water and they have had also given hot towels which was very greatly appreciated as they are quite valuable which was not given before also there were menu cards distributed for the dinner option before take off as the crew noted down the orders previously the meals options used to be on laminated cards i had opted for the fish curry with okra and that was quite a good and filling option along with a chocolate mousse cake for dessert unfortunately due to turbulence the crew were unable to do the beverage service which was good baggage retrieval was also swift overall i feel that the soft product was markedly improved from the last time i flew them in j class including the hot towels and menu cards with greater options but with the induction of new aircraft and refurbishment of cabin interiors i am quite optimistic that the business class product could get even better in the future only issue was the delay but that was due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft,1

AirIndia,1.0,whole food experience was disgusting,Kaminiben Joshi,2023-10-27,we flew business class from newark to bombay the comfort the legroom and the cleanliness was unspeakable however the food i was very highly dissatisfied with they started our journey with cold baba ghanouj and cold hummus with hard bread that as a starter no one seemed to enjoy out of the asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was an elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only i was happy to help for the main course it was an option between paneer or millet steak vegetarian as the air hostess was coming around to take our order she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good i told her i would not like that and i wanted the paneer after two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak i was seating in seat number 9 i couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal the millet steak was so disgusting everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset finally towards our landing we were served frozen chat and a veg grilled sandwich which was in fact only bread and cold squash in it it was making me vomiting because it was so bitter and tasted slimy and tasteless the whole food experience was disgusting,0
AirIndia,3.0,half of the screens werent working,Pravesh Dhanola,2023-10-27,i recently flew with air india and wanted to share my experience the service was good and the food was okay but my 8hour flight was marred by the fact that half of the screens werent working leaving me without any entertainment it made the journey quite hectic and im now concerned about my return flight despite assurances from the staff that they would reset the system no one came back to check if it worked im hesitant to fly with air india again and wouldnt recommend it to others,0
AirIndia,1.0,the worst airline to fly,S Jaival,2023-10-27,air india agents were extremely rude and almost got pushed by an agent at the gate owing to some extra weight in carry on they were unprofessional and unaccommodating they were bickering at other customers in the line if given a chance i’d never fly air india and would neither recommend it to friends and family the worst airline to fly,0
AirIndia,1.0,nothing is right,J Latshi,2023-10-27,air india dubai sector is strictly avoidable the flights never run on time everything sucks punctuality access to customer care ease to cancel tickets just nothing is right,0
AirIndia,2.0,entire experience left us deeply disappointed,M Kulkarni,2023-10-27,my family and i have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with air india this time it was my parents first trip from new delhi to san francisco leaving much to be desired i had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents as it was a gruelling 16hour flight and i paid for these seats when i booked the tickets however upon boarding the plane my parents were assigned seats in the middle section as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a lastminute payment for those seats at the airport this was not an isolated incident a similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from new delhi to san francisco to their surprise their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during checkin its evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue its deeply concerning that air indias ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice it appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during checkin my parents were left with no other options and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the checkin counter this is a clear indication that theres a systemic problem within air india and this practice is tarnishing the airlines reputation to make matters worse i applied for a refund but air india never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats this entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of air india such practices are unethical and damaging to the airlines reputation air india must take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure that passengers receive the services they pay for and are entitled to,0
AirIndia,2.0,spend your money on other airlines,S Harjeet,2023-10-27,staff is stubborn with deaf ear water is served as if last bottle in the world hot coffee is cold food quality is poor  spicy seat monitors don’t function and aircraft are too old spend your money on other airlines where people take care of you my last flight with them,0
AirIndia,1.0,be aware of this airline,S Singh,2023-10-27,flight landed 3 hours 25 mins late at final destination amritsar airport punjab they won’t acknowledge any responsibility and flat deny any sort of compensation the aviation authorities clearly state any flight delayed by three hours unless weather issues or landing over three hours late is a case for possible compensation this airline don’t want to communicate just keep sending you automated emails nobody will talk to you and more worrying than that is their planes are falling apart no proper maintenance carried out i wouldn’t fly with air india if it was free be aware of this airline,0
AirIndia,1.0,not a good experience,Saurabh Wahal,2023-10-09,the flight was supposed to take off at 825am but due to technical issues it kept getting delayed the problem here is that there was no clarification from the staff as to what was happening the flight took off at 12 pm as per the rules we were supposed to get a free meal but were provided only a bottle of water the seat of the aircraft was stinking inflight entertainment system was not working the staff on the aircraft looked disinterested in doing their job not a good experience,0
AirIndia,1.0,deep disappointment and frustration,Ravinder Kaur,2023-10-09,i am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding my recent travel experience with air india on august 31 2023 i had booked a flight ai309 from melbourne to delhi scheduled to depart at 800 am unfortunately this journey turned into a chaotic and inconvenient ordeal due to the cancellation of the flight and the subsequent mismanagement of the situation the cancellation of the flight itself was a major inconvenience i had specifically chosen a direct flight for the ease and comfort of traveling with my 3yearold daughter the direct flight option was the primary reason for selecting air india for this trip however when i arrived at the airport i was informed that the flight had been canceled this abrupt change in plans disrupted my entire travel schedule to make matters worse the alternative flight that was offered to us sri lanka airlines to colombo was not only indirect but also experienced significant delays this unexpected detour further complicated our travel plans and added unnecessary stress to an already frustrating situation the lack of clear communication and contingency planning was evident throughout this experience one of the most concerning aspects of this ordeal was the lack of consideration for the wellbeing of my 3yearold daughter and me during the extended waiting period we were forced to wait at the airport for 8 hours during which no meals were provided for my child this is unacceptable and demonstrates a lack of basic care for passengers especially young children who rely on a regular meal schedule the inconvenience caused to my daughter who was hungry and tired is deeply distressing i must express my disappointment with the overall handling of this situation by air india as a result of this experience i have lost faith in the reliability and customer service of your airline i can assure you that i will not consider air india for any future travel plans and i will actively discourage friends and family from doing so as well,0
AirIndia,1.0,pay 14000 inr because of extra luggage,Prachi Keemtani,2023-10-09,at the check in counter  i was allowed extra baggage and the person was very sweet he understood the fact i was travelling for an internship 10 mins before boarding  i was randomly asked to weigh my bags and to pay 14000 inr extra because of extra luggage which was preapproved in the end i was charged the money just because the flight had to take off i do not know if this was a game right from the checkin counter,0
AirIndia,3.0,a very disappointing experience,Deepak Sharma,2023-10-09,i had a very disappointing experience with air india i thought after taking over from the government the service would have improved however still long checkin queues and unfriendly staff at checkin desks i had a flight from delhi to london and my internal flight entertainment system was broken sadly instead of providing support i was told that sir i can confirm it won’t work also i was only allowed 3 can of beers on a 8 hour flight i was told due to airline regulations they can’t offer me more i will not fly again with them,0
AirIndia,1.0,seats were worn out uncomfortable,N Panir,2023-10-09,this review is regarding my recent roundtrip experience on air india flights from toronto to delhi and back to begin with the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair the seats were worn out uncomfortable and lacked proper cushioning the tray tables were broken in several instances making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose the inflight entertainment system or lack thereof was another major issue on both flights the screens were either malfunctioning or next to nonexistent my family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard moreover the meal service on these flights was subpar the food quality was far from satisfactory with unappetizing taste and limited options as a vegetarian i found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing it is essential to ensure that passengers are adequately catered to especially during longhaul flights where a comfortable and satisfying meal can significantly improve the overall experience,0
AirIndia,2.0,staff on both flights were poorly trained,John​ Arnold,2023-10-09,staff on both flights were poorly trained  it took them 90 minutes to start the now infamous entertainment system meals were average tasty ground staff in new delhi the very worst one could meet i requested a wheelchair the pusher couldnt find my gate info clueless transit security was a nightmare very poor communication english is an official language in india  not in new delhi airport i was taken to the wrong gate and left there i had no way of moving this chair not a self propel wheelchair  bhx baggage 1 hour i assumed my suitcase was lost it was removed from the belt sitting in a wheelchair gave me no visibility the wheelchair pusher vanished  bhx was an awful experience new delhi was even worse the boeing 7878 was old original fittings,0

AirIndia,1.0,avoid any flight with air india,Yechezkel Kashi,2023-09-26,our flight was canceled without any note from air india we even got an invitation to online check in and did that without any note from the company that the flight is not going to depart this is only the beginning of a story of a nightmare and irresponsibility of the air india the next flight was two days after and we were stuck in delhi and they refused to cover the minimum of the hotel for two days they only gave us refund for one night they promised to refund the taxi back to the airport but this didnt happen as well in the airport they lost our new ticket and it took an hour to get it back we spent hours to argue with the workers of the airline and it were not honest they promised lot of things but they were tricking us with all kind of excuses that were not real they said there isnt more ticket in an other flight and indeed there were they said the manager left home and indeed he was there and so on bottom line  we had a lot of expenses due to air india improper service we paid one night hotel the taxi to the airport food and living expenses and of course we lost two days of work at home we didnt even get answers to our refund mail query we recommend to avoid any flight with air india,0
AirIndia,3.0,it is highly inconvenient,Jaspreet kaur,2023-09-26,first of all my flight was delayed for about 5 hours with no notification no announcements or indication was given on asking about the flight they changed the gate 3 times without informing us i was only able to know about this because i was constantly checking the information boards while some old passengers were not able to do it and were struggling badly secondly the screens don’t work at all in the flight even if they work the remotes don’t work which is a big problem in flights with long routes the food was good staff was nice but all these challenges make it hard for us to opt for air india again as it is highly inconvenient thanks,0
AirIndia,10.0,a very good experience,S Lenton,2023-09-26,just today morning i landed at bangalore mine was a direct flight from san francisco i had an excellent comfortable journey and wanted to congratulate air india for providing such a wonderful service it had a very good leg room very comfortable seating very good food overall and a very good experience thanks a lot air india,1
AirIndia,7.0,business class is not roomy,R Marden,2023-09-11,business class on air india was just barely worth the extra cost for one thing they are using a domestic plane with one center aisle so 4 seats across in business and 6 across in economy there was nothing in the way of entertainment not even a screen business class is not roomy particularly when seats are reclined in front of you perhaps acceptable for domestic travel but not for international service by the crew was fine although they have an odd way of serving meal the man next to me finished his meal before i even received mine the problem with the menu and the choices is that unless you are indian if you are like me you have no idea what anything is thus i ordered the one western offering which was some sort of spaghetti mashup it was not made clear to me that i also had a choice of appetizers and desserts it certainly was a pleasant flight if unremarkable in any way this was my first time to have narrow bodied plane on this route i hope it is my last,1
AirIndia,8.0,a really comfortable and good flight,V Reddy,2023-09-11,i had to take the evening flight out from bangalore to mumbai over the weekend and after checking in and dropping the baggage got to know that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight from mumbai being delayed as this was the weekend the flight was quite full and i got to know from the crew that there was 1 passenger who was even allotted the jump seat one thing that was noticed was that even though the flight was delayed the crew and pilots were quite apologetic about it and explained the reasons for the delay however the pilots were in a rush and they didnt even announce nor notify the crew about taking their positions during takeoff and the crew had to rush to their jump seats on this sector i had noticed my copassenger who was sitting next to me was not feeling well and the crew was constantly monitoring him and looking after him giving him bottles of water to make him comfortable which was quite great from the crew for dinner i had opted for the non veg option that included a stuff paratha chicken masala with rice along with salad and a chocolate cake the meal was pretty good landing into bom was on time and was able to also get my baggage as well apart from the delay this was a really comfortable and good flight,1
AirIndia,1.0,this is the worst flight service,Srijan Thapa,2023-09-11,this is the worst flight service that someone can ever have if you call customer service for some enquiry they just hang up the phone the between they let you wait for 50 minutes just for the email confirmation and never get back to you even if you wait for like 10 hours first of all the problem started when we boarded the flight the flight was said to be delayed by 1 hour and after 1 hour another hour and after that another hour the flight gets delayed by another 3 hours and cancelled at last which gets rescheduled for another day,0
AirIndia,1.0,very disappointing that they didnt help me,Shaista Tabassum,2023-09-11,it was my worst flight will never travel air india again im 6 months pregnant when i asked the cabin crew for a seat change as it was very uncomfortable for me to sit in that position for a long time they refused and didnt even bother to help my situation even though there were many seats available with wide leg spaces still they said no seat was available it was very disappointing that they didnt help me as my back was hurting badly and i was feeling suffocated,0
AirIndia,3.0,one of the worst experiences,Maureen Dinkins,2023-09-11,this aircraft was in pretty bad shape the armrests were broken and dirty the remotes for the tvs didn’t work our tv was stuck on a white bright light the entire trip making it unable for us to sleep my tray table was broken and was unable to hold a tray of food without me holding it up with my other hand otherwise the food would’ve spilled onto my lap the staff was kind and nice they served us properly but the airplane itself was uncomfortable unclean and broken in many ways the seats were old and uncomfortable for a 13 hour flight it was one of the worst experiences i’ve ever had i fly to india annually  will not be taking this airline ever again,0

AirIndia,2.0,denied to take the bag saying that i am late,Anil Singhal,2023-08-19,ridiculous experience with air india flight from london to delhi i was supposed to board the flight from london on 15th aug at 1215 pm scheduled for departure at 115 pm i already did checkin tagged my bags and collected my boarding pass well before time and just had to do our baggage drop at the counter it was still 2 minutes left for the baggage counter closure at 1213 pm but the lady on the air india baggage counter d19 denied to take the bag saying that i am late and the counter is closed now i requested her very politely for help but there wasnt even an effort for help she rudely asked me to go to ticket counter and when i did air india executive asked me to cancel my current check in and pay late fees saying that i have to show as if i didnt turn up for the flight and came just before the flight take off and then pay additional fee for reschedule it was a hefty amount of £200 that was charged from me in addition to take another flight its a big shame on the air india service,0
AirIndia,2.0,plane seemed terribly run down,Stuart Allen,2023-08-19,the plane seemed terribly run down usb ports were broken toilet seats in the 2 toilets that i used were broken the entertainment system was not working at all several of the seats did not recline it was a tough 14 hours on top of this i got a stomach bug about 4 hours after eating the palik peneer lunch it seems they dont care about their plane they dont care about their customers they dont care about food hygiene,0
AirIndia,2.0,soon lose their customer base,Haresh Sonar,2023-08-19,my inlaws were booked to travel mumbai to tokyo via delhi the flight ai68707aug bom del departure was revised at 1800hrs without giving any reason to passengers due to the delayed departure of ai68707aug bom del they were rescheduled to fly on the next day after 24 hrs had ai staff tried and communicated with staff in delhi there was a possibility to be able to catch onward flight for tokyo but no such attempt was even tried by the staff there were other direct flights from deltyo ana or jal on same day which could have been the next option but no sincere attempts were made as a result my inlaws lost one complete day they were then sent to hotel sukh at juhu to travel to hotel it took 3 hrs taxi ride and while coming back it was 2 hrs my inlaws started their journey from nashik at 6 am in morning and could only reach the hotel at 9 pm it could have been so easily a hotel near airport on second day 8aug they were picked up at around 1100 am and made to catch 330 pm flight without lunch being offered the hotel even didn’t have basic facilities like soap availability as a common traveler i can easily understand that 400 pm flight being very important for travelers who connect to other international flights from delhi there should be alternative arrangements to make people catch the connecting flights if it was known that 400 pm flight is going to be delayed and there is no other flight available until 600 pm why efforts were not made to accommodate few passengers who have connections in earlier 330 pm we had to cancel all arrangements made for their pick up and rebook the car with driver from tokyo upon communication with ai they just offered apology but didn’t even bother to promise improvements if it continues like this ai would soon lose their customer base ai management should seriously think about their ground services and delays which cost their customers a huge amount of money,0

AirIndia,3.0,ife screens dont work,Gurpreet Kumar,2023-08-19,they dont have any name change policy and even if they promise to refund anything they will take two months just to let you know that they wont refund anything they have ife screens in front of each seat but they dont work ratio of screens working is 1 screen per 6 screens  you can find buses with better seats quality than an international air india flight air hostess service was nice,0
AirIndia,10.0,keep up the good work,Rajesh Nagar,2023-08-19,though my flight was delayed by 3 hours due to some technical issue i want to leave this feedback just for the cabin crew and the wonderful job they did i was flying with my whole team of 18 people and they took care of us throughout the flight special mention to mrs khushboo most humble and hard working air hostess ive ever seen she took care of me and my team and i cant ask for more the respect kindness and service top class keep up the good work,1
AirIndia,1.0,pathetic and unprofessional,M Benn,2023-08-19,worst airlines ever this is not the first time am travelling in international flight their crew thinks that we are first timers and judge on our requests for the services i paid inr 210 lacs for this flight what is more worst is for my flight from delhi to toronto which is 14 hours long and in return what i get is unmanaged toilets without paper rolls inflight infotainment not working properly in fact the passenger lady sitting next to me her screen would not even turn on ear jacks not working i watched the movie without sound the beverage services is ridiculous i asked for extra beer and the air hostess was like she would give it in another round well another round never came if these idiots cant give 6 cans of beer and better flight infotainment then why am i paying 200k for the ticket there are far better airlines which am going to opt for but definitely not air india anymore pathetic and unprofessional is at its peak,0
AirIndia,3.0,no different from a lowbudget airline,S Marton,2023-08-07,disappointing experience i recently traveled on air india from cochin to dubai on july 12th and returned from dubai to cochin on july 17th i am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight when i booked my tickets i had high expectations considering that tata group had taken over air india however i was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a lowbudget airline especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like emirates or qatar airways it was quite disconcerting to find that air india which is still considered a lowcost carrier had higher prices compared to other budget airlines furthermore i would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey during checkin i had checked in baggage weighing 265 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg at no point during the checkin process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight which would have allowed me to make purchases from the dutyfree area instead i was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram this approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience to comply with the sudden weight restriction i had to rush back to the dutyfree area and drop the items i had purchased i was warned by your staff that i might face deportation if i delayed the process as a gold member of qatar airways i am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations so i complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue this incident has left a significant impact on my perception of indian airlines i now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines whether it is air india under tata ownership or any other indian carrier the flight experience itself was underwhelming with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses causing discomfort and subsequent back pain considering the recent acquisition by tata group i had hoped for a significant improvement in air indias services but unfortunately it seems that air india remains unchanged it is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines this experience has left me deeply disappointed and i feel compelled to share my concerns with you i hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience as a frequent traveler i believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort communication and transparency to build a positive reputation thank you for your attention to this matter and i sincerely hope that air india will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future,0
AirIndia,1.0,bathrooms on the plane were disgusting,D Keale,2023-08-07,air india delayed our flight  they provided no food or drinks we werent allowed to leave the airport as we were in transit they delayed the flight due to operational needs waited for connecting passengers and are refusing compensation the bathrooms on the plane were disgusting pee all over the seats no toilet paper no paper towel and no tissues in all the bathrooms with used toilet paper all over the floor due to this delay we missed our connecting flights,0
AirIndia,1.0,horrible service,S Mangen,2023-08-07,horrible service from new delhi to vancouver on 20th july 2023 in flight entertainment not available at all completely unacceptable for a 145 hours flight personal reading lights and help button was not functional no beverages were provided in the flight passengers had to go and request the crew for same uncooperative and rude crew dirty interiors,0
AirIndia,5.0,outstanding service from staff,C Paldano,2023-08-07,newark to chennai via mumbai outstanding service from staff especially abhishek and venkatesan truly stood out tsa crew at newark airport werent the friendliest bunch and their impatience with nonenglish speakers was a real downer unfortunately the plane was showing its age two out of three inflight entertainment screens in my row were dead which is something of a letdown given that we were on a 15 hour flight but the food and overall service were topnotch upon landing in chennai we faced the dreaded baggage problem our checkedin bags seemed to have gone on their own adventure somewhere else after waiting for what felt like an eternity the air india representatives finally approached us they were polite but there was something off about their response i couldnt shake the feeling that they werent entirely transparent with us but an air india staff member at the chennai airport handled the situation with kindness efficiency and a determination to sort things out his professionalism left a lasting impression on me  im willing to fly with them again and eager to witness positive changes fingers crossed for a smoother ride next time,1
AirIndia,1.0,never ever again air india,Jeppe Juel Dam Sorensen,2023-08-07,at 039 in the morning you are informed a 6 hours delayed of your connecting flight leaving you in delhi airport for 8 hours later delayed 1 more hour so 9 hours originally i was to be fetched in cph at comfortably 1845 instead i had to book a taxi mid night never have i experienced such poor service now talking about the seats  my monitor was falling apart only kept together by duct tape the toilet  there were a small lake of urine on the floor not just one but the three i tried before looking for a bag and duct tape no i just had to wait out the experience of flying with air india but never ever again air india,0
AirIndia,3.0,disappointed to the core,B Watani,2023-08-07,had one of the worst experiences being a frequent flyer our flight from bangkok arrived 20 minutes prior to the expected time collected our baggage went through customs and other formalities just to reach the domestic air india counter to find out that our flight was delayed departure by 2 hours and the airport staff went let us go to the departure gates area as our boarding procedure was pushed coz of the delay too me along with my wife and 2 kids had to unwillingly wait at the international exit where none of the few charging sockets were working and the sitting are was so crowded that restless passengers had to sleep on the floors im sure many others would agree to seeing this happen spent 3 hours sitting on the seats with eyes full of sleep and tiredness i assume that airlines are treating passengers according to their places of arrival and dominate passengers coz of the routes being less favorite by delaying flights unnecessary etc im shocked how a key player like air india act so unprofessionally after being in business for a very long time disappointed to the core,0
AirIndia,3.0,going from bad to worst,S Sunila,2023-08-07,bad treatment took air india flt no 129 on 15th july 545 am departure what i experienced was not expected from air india after breakfast we had to ask for a cup of tea which very conveniently got over just before our front row the steward too conveniently did turn up finally i had to request staff who in turn was kind enough to provide us tea even though she was not in charge of the muddle row it didnt end here the same thing he repeated the same after the afternoon meals when i requested him he said tea is over and will get it he didnt turn up with tea till end this type of treatment is not expected from air india it is also very strange that we in the middle row is served meals at the end by this time the both the other rows are almost done with their meals air india is going from bad to worst no value for money ai is not charging anything less than other airlines then why such nasty treatment to their own countrymen,0
AirIndia,1.0,was given a regular meal,Simon Taylor,2023-08-07,requested a gluten free meal and was given a regular meal i even double checked at check in about my request and although the staff couldn’t see my request was told it will be fine which it wasn’t,0
AirIndia,1.0,both times it was torture,Rohit Kaushal,2023-08-07,worst planes i have ever been in while taking an international flight i took same flight from melbourne to delhi with in a span of two weeks and both times flight was same flight entertainment didnt work both times even though it is direct flight for 125hours mobile charging usb plugs didnt work and flight crew went to sleep after serving breakfast you can imagine the torture of sitting on tiny seat with no entertainment no mobile phone and no service when i raised concern with customer care they first promised to fix it by giving me 200 fff points but then i said i prefer better service and i am happy to donate my points then they offered me 25 of of the total flights i took but no nothing was given i sent emails twice to see progress but after 3 months nothing has been done i paid almost double coz it was a direct flight and both times it was torture,0
AirIndia,1.0,flight was disgusting and dirty,Ann Benny Alackal,2023-08-07,i have been flying for the past 21 years and never have i seen such a poorly conditioned international flight your flight was disgusting and dirty the toilet situation was horrendous and had a disgusting smell all the time also your entertainment service was not available for the entire 15 hr flight the meals were exceptionally nasty and tasteless it is such a shame to represent india with this kind of flight the only part i was satisfied with was the service from one of your staff she was kind and nice to everyone i am not writing this review with the hope that you will address all your flight issues but at least i want you to acknowledge the horrible service you are providing,0
AirIndia,1.0,gotten progressively worse,R Singh,2023-07-18,sometime around 2017 i got the patriotism bug after avoiding air india like a plague for years i decided to travel with air india well the first time from sfoccu and back wasn’t bad however as the years have progressed air india has gotten progressively worse yes air india seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of tata without recounting every horror story that i have about air india i will simply and briefly share my experience with air india flying back from ccu to ewr on june 30 2023 as we got to the airport i was prepared for the rudeness the staff members of indigo spice etc seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner however air india staff seemed just sad and pathetic so then we get on our flight from ccu to del the food is inedible the ac doesn’t seem to be working and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight okay so then we get to delhi now i don’t if it’s just an attitude issue perhaps something cultural in delhi or air india but air india staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent somehow i got called in for a secondary inspection apparently having a zippo without fuel is not allowed by cisf anyway so after being harassed by them i get back to the gate and the air india staff has somehow lost my boarding pass which they had kept when i went to see the cisf people instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two air india staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass finally they find it again no apology so i being exhausted get on the flight this time i had made sure to get on the flight early since on my way to kolkata they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so i had to store them in two different overhead bins so i was relieved when i saw the overhead bins empty i had booked extra legroom seats however the moment i start putting my luggage an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me i inform her that it was my seat and i will keep my luggage there she proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for oversized baggage so at this point i lose my cool so let me understand this instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight like a normal airline air india has decided to punish passengers who are following the rule anyway i told the flight attendant that i will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that she mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2 whatever however somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight as expected the inflight entertainment system did not work funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat however i regret eating the pathetic food that air india provided i kid you not the salad they gave was literally rotten didn’t they know that mayonnaise rots very easily and does not need to be warmed up what was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight at some point like a good passenger i had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner however when the attendant came she seemed agitated gestured toward the front of the flight and said you can throw it in,0
AirIndia,2.0,most disappointed,S Sethi,2023-07-18,my flight was supposed to depart new delhi at 2300hrs it was first delayed until 0200hrs on the following day closer to the time they delayed it further to 0500hrs no reason provided i am still at the airport in new delhi do not know if they will delay it most disappointed with this supposedly new era of air india in may 23 also travelled in this airline when we found the food on board was inedible and the inflight entertainment system was not working its was on the premium sector of london to new delhi,0
AirIndia,7.0,this was a welcome flight,Ashish Varun,2023-07-18,i took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate the online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger a321 for this sector i had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see also surprisingly on this flight sector i had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich i had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good landing and arrival into blr was also well ahead of time however when the time came to collect the baggage i had noticed that again the new bag tag which i had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that i had just purchased recently and put even last week when i travelled from kolkata to mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off so it seems that air india is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into but other than that this was a welcome flight and i am hoping that the next time i travel they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give,1
AirIndia,1.0,company to really avoid,Nicola Mazzucchelli,2023-07-18,flight to go to india was 9 hrs delayed today flew back to italy 7 hrs delay no service nothing this is a company to really avoid most of international flights delayed bad company never never use again,0
AirIndia,8.0,excellent service provided by staff,H Harmeenan,2023-07-18,i would like to express my gratitude for the excellent service provided by staff the air hostesses praveet and preeti were exceptional in their duties and displayed a remarkable level of professionalism throughout the flight while the overall service was commendable i would like to bring to your attention a minor issue regarding the inflight entertainment system unfortunately the screens in our section were not working properly,0
AirIndia,2.0,entertainment did not work,valentine Beatini,2023-07-18,bad experience 2 long flights 6 hours delay without compensation on both flights the sockets and the entertainment did not work not mine nor the socket of the adjacent seats the cabin staff is nice and pretends that the problem is solvable but they seem pretty aware that it is not for the delay upon request a ticket was provided for a lounge which was actually a loud café offering another meal very much like the one on the plane and 033 ml water,0
AirIndia,1.0,the service was nonexistent,S Jensen,2023-07-18,with tata having purchased air india and air india being a star alliance partner i thought what could go wrong my new name for air india is air never again the seats service cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible we flew nine carriers on our monthlong trip none of them were close to being as bad as air india the discount air carriers scoop and batik put air india to shame the direct competitors singapore united and cathay were so far superior that youd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on air india again the plane was filthy the seats torture devices left over from the middle ages my inseat entertainment system was broken but functional i pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a no one cares shrug the service was nonexistent the flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service they just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley the food was the worst of any airline food ive eaten or tried to eat the beverage service was miserly nope one and done loved india been there several times will go again just not on air india,0
AirIndia,6.0,i would still recommend,S Hashun,2023-07-18,as i had booked this flight at a discount rate i was a bit anxious about whether i would get a seat on this flight considering it was the weekend and planes have been flying full literally to my surprise i didnt have to wait for long in order to check in and get my boarding pass the flight boarding and departure were on time and there were a few vacant seats for breakfast i opted for the veg option which was consisting of an uttapam sev upma a croissant with mango yogurt which was pretty good however during the beverage service i noticed that the staff were initially serving the front couple of rows but then due to turbulence they had to stop it midway but didnt bother to proactively ask the passengers for beverages when they were taking away the eating trays which was a surprise perhaps they might have just forgotten or due to the turbulence they had to stop it midway without asking passengers but either way that wasnt good arrival to mumbai was on time however i had noticed that upon retrieval of my luggage my baggage name tag that i had put had got torn out which was not good as previously back in january too they had misplaced my luggage and again they had not handled the baggage properly so this is something that they need to look into i would still recommend as i got huge value for the fare that i paid,1
AirIndia,1.0,first and last flight with air india,K Singh,2023-07-18,i travelled in direct flight from toronto to delhi with my brother on 26 june 2023 the entire plane smelled like public washroom it was so disgusting the entertainment screen was not working for me and my brother and for many more people we informed the crew member and she assured it will be fixed soon two hours later when i asked them again all they had to say was sorry we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it the meal they served was not fresh my brother had booked nonveg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal that too 1 hour late than others and had hair in it when we asked the crew she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange you guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you forget the rest we paid 2300 cad for the ticket which i think was not worth it this was probably my first and last flight with air india never travelling again and wont even recommend it to anyone,0

AirIndia,10.0,top notch crew experience,T Sharma,2023-07-05,i had the opportunity to travel on ai flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to india i havent been adventurous enough to try them out international as ive heard my share of horror stories im going to base my review on the 2 punedelhi flights ive taken in this period booking ai fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines ai is full service which means 25 kgs of checkin luggage and meals served onboard a huge win right away online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites rating 1010 check in the checkin counter for ai literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones that did make me somewhat nervous the first time as it turns out eventually the flights both times were completely full so i have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at checkin maybe fewer flights nevertheless the checkin agent was quick efficient polite addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate i was out and about in no time  both times no complaints rating 1010 boarding boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled on both the flights i took however the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time rating 810 crew on both occasions the cabin stewards  stewardesses were polite efficient and thoroughly professional albeit the first flight they werent overly keen to smile on the second flight they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please a very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience 1010 the craft this was an older a320 not the neo version strangely there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and i had non working screen controls none of the others did i guess they reused some seats from other aircraft the seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers at 5ft7 i had decent enough knee room but the seat width  that was definitely a bonus wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer a350s and b787s that made a huge impact and i did not have to fight it out with my copassenger for rights over the arm rest of course the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics but it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting rating 710 meals dinner was served chicken korma with rice and some veggies some yoghurt and a brownie cake was decent fare served with steel cutlery thank you ai international carriers make note its criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery why do you do it the cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and i did a stress test it was actually quite rigid and strong well done service was quick and as efficient as how i was getting used to by now 810 punctuality both times on ai the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached new delhi 3035 mins ahead of schedule i repeat  3035 mins ahead of schedule on a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs this is serious wow super impressed 1010 extras throughout the trip i kept getting emails and smss from ai with status updates on departure gates and other bits and bobs of info i even got alerts for when my bags were loaded onto the aircraft who does that whopping 1010 overall an overwhelmingly surprised 1010,1

AirIndia,1.0,web checkin was harrowing,AP Pandey,2023-06-27,the web checkin was harrowing they disabled the default free seat that was assigned after selecting another seat and there was no way to return to the default option this is a bit of a scam when one is forced to pay for a seat equivalent to the autoassigned seat the customer service was of no help at all,0

AirIndia,1.0,worst inflight experience,Hemant Bhadana,2023-06-27,worst inflight experience i’ve ever had tv screens not working nor there is a facility to call crew seats are broken and the food served was pathetic had to wait for 34 hours to get even water during flight heard bad reviews about air india before and thought there will be improvements after its acquired by tata but no difference never travel again if possible completely avoid,0
AirIndia,1.0,customer service is getting worse day by day,Abhishek Raj,2023-06-27,air india has very poor customer service onboard the aircraft no flight attendant came to even offer water after 34 hours snacks were given before the beginning of the flight in 14 hours of the flight only 1 time a meal was provided there was also no warm food customer service is getting worse day by day everyone expected that since mr ratan tata took over air india he would make necessary steps to improve customer service make flight tickets more reasonable and improvements in aircraft interior including tv screens in front of the seats but unfortunately nothing has improved it is disappointing at the airport after checking in for the international flight from delhi to toronto my motherinlaw was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time couple of staff members of the star alliance harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to toronto i do not understand who gives airlines air india or star alliance authority to ask for passengers return flight this is ridiculous and i hope my message reaches the right authority in india to take necessary steps to stop such nonsense behavior at the airport if i still had option for travelling with jet airways i would never ever travel with air india sadly jet airways is no longer active,0

AirIndia,1.0,ai has given nothing but lousy service,H Norton,2023-06-20,can an airline be this inefficient from beginning to end ai has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous i landed in delhi at 11pm and my plane to toronto was supposed to leave at 335am they said that it was delayed and will start at 5am the staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 330am our documents were checked three times at least just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done there was no order to the boarding we boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane a closed space with people coughing in 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers we are being treated as cattle and not human beings there’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop this is a broken down plane nothing works for a 14 12 hour nonstop flight there’s no entertainment honestly at this point i wonder if i will get where i need to get alive and in one piece ai is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time we have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip this is the second time i have flown ai in 6 months for lack of finding any other airline and this is the second time i’ve sat in the plane for 4 hours while technical issues are being dealt with i would give this negative stars if the option were available,0

AirIndia,7.0,amazing legroom,Shanthanu Naidu,2023-04-04,here is my experience onboard air indias boeing 7878 the airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past on entering the cabin and reaching my seat i found the cabin to be a little unclean but the seat was good but the best part yet about air india was their amazing legroom it was so much that i kind of got a feeling of sitting in premium economy without the premium economy service of course the footrests provided also gave a good impression the food was decent but the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken as a result i ended up watching certain shows without sound and the entertainment system by itself wasnt good whats the point of adding categories when there is absolutely no content in that particular category overall apart from the entertainment system the experience onboard air india was quite good i would gladly fly them if there are improvements in the ife and cabin cleanliness,1

AirIndia,1.0,appalling airline,S Harjesh,2023-03-18,appalling airline my flight from mumbai to bengaluru air india 609 scheduled to depart on march 1 at 800 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’ we finally boarded at 1000 am and started taxiing the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’ all passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus the passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers finally the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checkedin bags leading to total chaos after collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the checkin counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight during the entire fiasco the air india staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight the irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening an entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight to add insult to injury the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation i learnt subsequently that my experience with air india was not uncommon i caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline i will never ever book a flight on this airline again,0
AirIndia,1.0,no accountability or professionalism,Harshit Agarwal,2023-03-18,its a disgrace no accountability or professionalism after takeover by tata one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed incessant delays bad food broken chairs it doesnt deserve to be called an international airline its worse than domestic airline the staff are completely disorganized and untrained my flight was cancelled without reason then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasnt enough they made us sit inside aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon after that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr air india you should close your operations and stop tarnishing indias name people of india are normally cost conscious and thats the only reason i guess they fly with ai when they get a better deal but i feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this,0
AirIndia,3.0,complete disaster,Neeraj Jaggi,2023-03-18,complete disaster the business class is definitely not worth it but thats not the worst part the ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent i flew from delhi to jfk via mumbai and needless to say i had a confirmed ticket in business class in delhi air india ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from mumbai to jfk so they gave me a boarding pass for mumbai to jfk flight where in place of seat number it said stb i boarded the flight from delhi to mumbai and upon arriving in mumbai went to the air india counter in mumbai to get my boarding pass for the mumbai to jfk flight with a valid seat number now the fun part begins i was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation layover unfortunately i showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in delhi remember stb which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet the lady immediately calls for help she discusses with the person who came to help she first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other so i wait after around 1015 minutes when i inquire again she says she is trying her best but that i am on standby remember stb she said she needs to speak with her supervisor i spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor they finally gave me the boarding pass but they took my delhi to mumbai boarding pass perhaps my bad and i had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt upon boarding the flight the business class section i was in was almost empty and they were repairing my seat not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition the seat was torn remote barely functioning with no flight map food was ok fortunately i had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable,0
AirIndia,1.0,a total disgrace,Sami Saghie,2023-03-18,a total disgrace flight delayed overnight nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice flying to jfk from indore via mumbai flight from mumbai to jfk delayed 14 hours for now maybe longer took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service no cable no television in the middle of a shanty with no contact to the outside world other than paying 100 so i can access my us phone plan no change of clothing its a complete disgrace its your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of all i got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do complete disgrace every time i fly this airline i regret it,0
AirIndia,5.0,the seats did not recline,Abhishek Shetty,2023-03-18,the flight was ontime leg room was not bad the inflight stewardesses were attentive checkin was efficient with the generous baggage allowance one of the main reasons i opted for air india and baggage was delivered promptly however the aircraft was a tired and old a319 where the seats did not recline the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious it was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy tasteless sandwich which was offered,1
AirIndia,1.0,horrible service,Swadha Vaid,2023-03-05,horrible service the aircraft had a technical issue and no one informed the passengers about the fault the flight is already an hour and a half delayed the flight staff is utter useless and disrespectful no courtesy to provide water or even inform the passengers about the timeframe,0
AirIndia,1.0,i was very disappointed,S Jaylani,2023-03-05,i was very disappointed that none of the screens on inbound and outbound flights were working  i have difficulty sleeping on a flight so to pass 8 to 9 hours without inflight entertainment is next to impossible the food is not that nice either,0
AirIndia,2.0,service gone so down,S Hayana,2023-03-05,i was flying with my friends flight was packed none of seat screen was working no one listening to say sorry about this when food was serving staff were asking all what would you like have veg or non veg as all says veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all it supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last in return on 1 march same issue even when they serve the food tea cup was dirty  service gone so down  very poor when they charge a lot not worth money to spend on air india,0
AirIndia,5.0,food was below average quality,R Barton,2023-03-05,flight out on time good service seat ok screen not working food reasonable return flight changed 1 day before text and phonecall actually to a better time but on the day 50min delay at least 30min of which was standing in a corridor seat was creaky and uncomfortable food was below average quality service was polite and efficient overall i would only go air india if the price was good which to be fair it was but i would probably pay a bit more for a better experience if available,1
AirIndia,3.0,not a good value for money,Marina Rodrigues,2023-03-05,my seats were changed as it was termed unserviceable on both sectors new york to delhi on jan 27 2023 and delhi to new york on march 1 2023  the explanation given was shallow the fleet is old seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty the restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly headphone given was not working just one side worked it is my first experience traveling air india business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering not a good value for money considering the tickets are so expensive,0
AirIndia,3.0,did not answer any call button,C Ganapathy,2023-03-05,the inflight entertainment was broken the crew dont provide water or beverages and did not answer any call button food was ok but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks water in between i later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from the staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference ground service made us wait in a long queue sfo  dont know why they were so slow in clearing i clicked recommend air india as i am keeping my fingers crossed and hope this airline gets it right in future,1
AirIndia,1.0,beyond a horrible experience,A Kaldan,2023-03-05,i travelled on feb 15th from newark to mumbai ai144 traveling along with me was my 15 yr son to say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement let me start with tvs did not work reading lights did not work the call buttons did not work the tray tables were broken  bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together i saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off landing and when they served the 3 meals no once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys i can keep going but i am going to stop i get it that air india is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience a 14hour flight with zero amenities i call that torture i do want to let you know that i did cancel my return flight to newark and booked on another airline and i was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight i was not looking for the fancies but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money i paid,0
AirIndia,8.0,service was quite nice,V Abbas,2023-03-05,after the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an air india flight i was cautious about flying this sector as i did not want any unforeseen surprises the fare was reasonable for this oneway flight however during checkin i was surprised to see that air india has started charging for seat selection this was never the case before as before it got privatized we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same and as air india is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this the baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems the boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board however one thing i did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board also as this was an evening flight the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea  coffee the food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side the flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice air india has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved,1
AirIndia,1.0,very pathetic service,Cajetain Sequeira,2023-03-05,very pathetic service second time  9pm flight delayed were still at mumbai airport and clueless on what is happening no water no food air india at its lowest same experience on 15th feb morning 5am flight,0

AirIndia,4.0,unexpected and unhappy experience,M Wakade,2023-02-25,recently travelled with my 2 months baby and oldage mom and had very unexpected and unhappy experience with the flight attendant because i was having my 2 months old baby and my mothers height was not enough to reach the baggage area i asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage she straight away rejected my request very rudely other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help the flight attendant knew that my moms height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her dont just stare you have to put your bags by your own if you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for if we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help forget about humanity at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty i hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had have a safe and happy travel,0

AirIndia,8.0,its prices are reasonable,R Bardin,2023-02-18,i chose to fly air india because of its star alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable in general i was quite pleased with the flight the business class section on air indias international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth the colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty i believe it is overdue for an upgrade the seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping i kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet  there is a wide selection of food choices and i enjoyed my choice the service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight the entertainment services pale in comparison to other international airlines only a few movies are offered i would not hesitate to fly air india again,1

AirIndia,2.0,worst experience of my life,Prerna Arora,2023-01-14,travelling by air india has been the worst experience of my life utterly disgusting change of date of flying on short notice and worst the message wasnt updated and showed the original date of flying change of route instead of my non stop flight the airline changed with stop over delay of take off for more than 5 hrs and not even a single refreshment or water served while waiting more than 1 hr seated in aircraft no updates of time of take off,0

AirIndia,1.0,hygiene on these flights is horrendous,Sagel Patel,2023-01-14,i recently decided to travel with air india to india and i must say i am severely disappointed and definitely will not be booking again with air india i flew on the 23rd of nov 2022 from heathrow to delhi and then delhi to ahmedabad my flight to heathrow to delhi was disappointing i paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working i told the flight attendant twice she then said she will reset the system although that didn’t work so i told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where i can sit  how can i get up and leave my seat when i’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple  why did i pay extra money for a specific seat when air india can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained secondly hygiene on these flights is horrendous i opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues there were sticky stains on the side which i wiped off with a baby wipe i would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from london but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy now i have just returned from india to heathrow with my mother again via air india and what a disappointment again flew on 1311 from ahmedabad our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots no alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 945 hours  i think you can now understand when i say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire the planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault now for the next piece of resistancé my younger sister is due to fly tomorrow i also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with air india we were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight original travel was lhr to bom and then bom to indore with a 4 hour lay over we had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover but opted to pay extra to avoid waiting so anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours no emails received about this change we received multiple about her return being changed i call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call soham who was so confusing i would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of english to your call centre staff soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled why was this not made clear in writing after a good 25 minutes soham clarified that only option is lhr to del and wait for 11 hours and then del to indore  why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes if my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money this specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting in conclusion i’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions,0
AirIndia,9.0,excellent experience on board,Gargi Mankame,2023-01-14,excellent experience on board aircraft seating was very comfortable and staff was friendly and efficient special mention of ms sohoni and ms mishra,1
AirIndia,1.0,2 day delay in our travel plan,N Shantar,2023-01-14,was supposed to fly air india from mumbai to melbourne via delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning flight from mumbai to delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection then we were made to leave the gates collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do giving us no information and no compensation finally about 67 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day and we would have to find our own accommodation in mumbai not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in delhi they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesnt work this has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point never again,0
AirIndia,1.0,air india is disgusting,Sana Patel,2023-01-14,air india is disgusting they removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent they then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later the hotel is a dump its disgusting just like air india service as a whole i had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them i am stuck in delhi i could have made it on the indigo flight but they refused to book for me the staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it this airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are,0
AirIndia,5.0,does not reflect well on the new owners,V Reddy,2023-01-14,this early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy i had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in india and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays the crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in mumbai one point to note here is that air india does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours so what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine however the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival after inquiring about the same i was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight the staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage the last 2 times i traveled on air india they were not positive experiences the first one was when i had got a boarding pass for a flight i was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage there was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage this does not reflect well on the new owners hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins but these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers i have already had 2 negative experiences travelling on the airline within the space of 2 months,0
AirIndia,1.0,check in was chaotic and unorganised,Rameez Qamar,2023-01-14,this is our national carrier and unfortunately one of the worst and most unprofessional airlines you’d never come across a staff smiling ground or air the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the govt owned airline even now when it has been taken over check in was chaotic and unorganised seats were wobbly seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching infotainment screen was broken schedule was not followed sadly i will pay 50 extra to a different airline but never fly on air india unless there are no other options available pathetic service and they do not deserve any sympathy,0
AirIndia,7.0,,Venkata Gudlavalleti,2023-01-14,excellent food on the hyderabad to london leg but food on the return leg was just ordinary excellent cabin crew special mention needs to be made of ms padma who was so caring and helpful on both legs of the journey the entertainment system was not working on either legs punctuality was excellent toilets were well maintained and the pilots were superb it was a smooth take off and landing on both legs i could sleep on both legs comfortably,1
AirIndia,5.0,dirty seats and covers,Pratishthit Chauhan,2023-01-14,food quality poor tv screen not working when requested to the purser for looking into this it was a very casual answer they rebooted but never worked the answer was cannot do anything but is it not airline responsibility to ensure all facilities are working airplane old with dirty seats and covers,0
AirIndia,1.0,most disgusting service,S Patel,2023-01-02,my bag did not come off the plane there was no reason given there has been no updates there has been no feedback i am on day 2 without a bag in a foreign country they havent provided any compensation for me not having my medication or clothing they had time for me to sign an indemnity but they couldnt care less what is happening to me without my bags most disgusting service and worst airline ever,0
AirIndia,9.0,staff were friendly and helpful,Pavani Vellal,2023-01-02,the air india staff were friendly and helpful my child left her toy in the aircraft and we realized this after we got off the airplane when we mentioned about this to the air india staff they were kind enough to help get the toy back to my child we appreciate the kindness and the hospitality of the staff special thanks to vishna marsuk and vyshna for going the extra mile to keep customers happy and make our trip experience pleasant,1
AirIndia,1.0,please avoid this airline,S Garner,2023-01-02,this is the worst experience with air india i want to tell everyone please avoid this airline no good food no good service simple dont fly with air india tata sir you bought this airline please also hire well and train staff people paying lot of money to buy tickets these days customer service even worst support system i ever talked they just don’t care about you they received your money and after customer service dont even reply your emails for any inquiries,0
AirIndia,1.0,this flight was appalling,Kunaal Patel,2023-01-02,this flight was appalling the plane was filthy none of the tvs worked and were disgusting stains were on the window seating lumbar didn’t work and the plane smelled as we boarded at delhi airport air india staff were disorganised and in some cases rude worst airline i have ever flown with several people lost their luggage i will never fly with them again,0
AirIndia,1.0,never using the airline again,S Marzon,2023-01-02,never getting into any plane with the name air india inflight entertainment system was broken on 12 hours flight water was leaking inside the plane seats were hard as concrete toilets dirty food was horrible and staff at new delhi airport were rude and arrogant many passengers have no respect to others personal space and would sit on someones seat and refuse to move i faced the same problem on my return flight never using the airline again,0
AirIndia,1.0,worst experience of my life,J Landon,2023-01-02,worst experience of my life i paid more than 1500 to get to india from the us even though there were flights for 900 the reason is that air india had a nonstop flight from the us i tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight although i requested english speaking reps on the 800 number all the people had only elementary understanding of english and for some reason they would hang up the phone in midconversation i even had a friend call and the same happened to her i ended up talking another airline to india and flying back on air india which was horrible and i do not recommend it i also want to warn people my card was charged almost 151749 air india admitted the problem was on their end but i was only refunded 125366 for some reason they decided to keep 26433 that is the first issue the second was the actual flight  i was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water i asked if they had a larger cup because i was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didnt understand english or she pretended she didnt understand english because she shrugged and walked away the food was horrible the seats were horrible and had very little room non of the screens worked and even worse none of the outlets that are in planes for recharging your device worked when i ran out of battery on my ipad i tried to read but the light did not work in my entire row one of the worst experiences on multiple levels please  if you want to protect your money and your comfort look for another airlines,0
AirIndia,1.0,complete waste of money,P Reddy,2023-01-02,probably the worst airline experience ive ever had while flying from sydney to delhi no gluten free food was available despite it being confirmed on the air ticket while returning only one of the three in flight entertainment systems were working in our row thats 125 hours of staring at a screen that doesnt work with nothing else to do this is also despite having paid close to 7000 for our flights complete waste of money  unlikely to ever fly with them again,0
AirIndia,10.0,great food and customer service,Ronak Gani,2023-01-02,great food and customer service the staff were very friendly the food options and drink options were plenty i had very limited time to catch flight from delhi to ahmedabad however staff helped a lot,1
AirIndia,3.0,dropped the ball here big time,V Agar,2023-01-02,i was booked on a waitlist flight from ccu to bom this morning which was pretty much overbooked especially in mid week which was surprising i had resigned myself to not getting any seat on the flight as it was pretty full but then at the last moment the supervisor managed to print my boarding pass and i believed that i was actually going to fly onboard the flight or so i thought after clearing the serpentine security line i rushed to the boarding gate hoping to catch my flight and that is when a big surprise was up in store for me where it was revealed by the boarding gate agents that i would be unable to board as a regular pax had taken my place this was pretty jarring especially at the last moment so i then had to make my way back to the check in desk to retrieve my luggage which had to be offloaded from the flight the point here is why was the boarding pass issued to me when there was no guarantee that i would get a seat onboard the flight if the staff had informed me that there are no seats i would have understood and resigned myself to that fact instead by printing my boarding pass it gave me a false sense of hope which was clearly not correct the purpose of me writing this review is not to bash anyone but to highlight there there are certain aspects of waitlist bookings that should be handled better here i may also have to reconsider going for waitlist bookings with the airline if this practice continues and in this regard air india dropped the ball here big time i hope that the airline takes the feedback onboard here regarding this,0
AirIndia,10.0,outstanding hospitality,A Reddy,2023-01-02,one of the outstanding services i have ever experienced especially the excellent neatness for the cost of my ticket other airlines typically do not offer minimum of refreshments however with air india passengers had enough good meals and i am thankful to the air india staff for their outstanding hospitality,1
AirIndia,7.0,on time departure and arrival,Brian Dahl,2022-12-11,excellent flight on time departure and arrival the inflight service was the best i have even received in my over 30 years of international travel the food was good alcohol was  ok in flight entertainmentpoor aircraft condition very poor the flight attendant went beyond his duty to serve and please passengers maybe it was because tata had just purchased the airline,1
AirIndia,1.0,i would not recommend this airline,Shareek Singh,2022-12-11,horrible airline broken tv broken equipment at the seat food is mediocre at best seats were changed and downgraded without refund i would not recommend this airline to anyone,0
AirIndia,1.0,customer care and cabin crew are very rude and uncooperative,Parul Jain,2022-12-11,customer care and cabin crew are very rude and uncooperative the ground staff gave a prebooked seat of a passenger couple with a child to another passenger without a reason and then were being rude to them the poor couple didn’t get a seat with a bassinet despite booking it 4 months in advance with a confirmed status this is horrible and corrupt service all i can say is this happens only in air india,0
AirIndia,2.0,worst flight ever,Parvinder Sidhu,2022-12-11,worst flight ever no entertainment system works no phone charger broken seats even the flight announcement didn’t work imagine a emergency announcement not reaching to passengers,0
AirIndia,6.0,i am truly impressed,C Tan,2022-12-11,air india you most certainly have improved with your inflight cabin crew and your inflight fb i am truly impressed as previous experiences under its previous owner was mostly bad but at least they used the b787 for sinbom 1911 sinbom airbus 320 2511 bomsin airbus 320 both flights were  full what baffled me was why someone in air india would deploy this aircraft configuration for an international long haul 55hrs flight with seats with no seat pocket the back of the seat only has document holder the cabin had no power supply no usb port so at least have seat pockets that allow customers to place their power bank in the seat pocket while charging their gadget instead of having to place the power bank inbetween ones groin region my other ai domestic flights bomgoi and return had seat pockets for a 90 minute flight this could have been a 1010 review,0
AirIndia,9.0,cabin crew were absolutely delightful,Jagdeesh Singh Dhaliwal,2022-12-11,this year due to a family emergency we needed to travel to india urgently and we reluctantly booked an air india flight in economy due to the lack of other viable options the check in staff at melbourne were pleasant helpful and efficient we had to queue but the line kept moving the ground staff member was cheerful and upbeat and really seemed to enjoy talking to people and took pride in his job our boarding was on time and orderly and our flight departed exactly on time the highlight was the attitude of the cabin crew  during the twelve hour flight our cabin crew were absolutely delightful they looked happy and we had a nice chat about the indian wines being served on air india during the bar service they emanated a sense of warmth and caring the professionalism and warmth of the cabin crew on this flight was probably the best we have ever experienced we enjoyed the food very much also very nicely seasoned we can see that the aircraft interiors are looking a little tired but we understand that a programme of refurbishment is underway,1
AirIndia,6.0,disappointed with the customer care,Khajuria Aseem,2022-12-11,i am quite disappointed with the customer care services of air india as they have not been able to refund the amount that they have charged twice for a ticket which i had bought in august 2022 despite number of assurances given in response to my emails and also numerous conversations with their customer care executives and senior team leaders every time they assured that the money will be refunded within next seven days but this excuse has been repeated for about seven times till date but to no avail  i have eventually decided to forget this amount and have decided not to remind them about it anymore as they have tired me out however i do feel air india needs to take some corrective measures to have a transparent and effective customer care set – up,1
AirIndia,9.0,received very nice service,P Tayel,2022-12-11,received very nice service from rajani during my journey from delhi to  canada on flight ai 187 date 21 nov 2022 she is very cooperative and humble,1
AirIndia,2.0,worst flight i have even taken,K Gupta,2022-12-11,worst flight i have even taken the entertainment screens were not working the seat was not reclining and the seat felt like i was siting on a plank did not get any good response from the air hostesses longest 14 hour flight for me till now they didn’t have any blankets the air hostess calling light were only lighting on top of the passenger seat panel but air hostess don’t have any clue that passenger is calling them you have to talk to the pantry area to ask for help the flight is not cheap but it didn’t have anything to comfort the passenger,0
AirIndia,5.0,the food was good,J Thornton,2022-12-11,the seats had sufficient legroom but the cushioning was really bad i felt pain after the first hour even after i placed the neck pillow provided it didnt help the food was good the toilets were clean the stewards were not stingy on the drinks and snacks the main reason i opted for this is because this is the only direct flight to kochi and i thought i would be able to adjust for a 9hr flight but i was proved wrong the touch screen didnt work the usb charging port and the headphone jack connector was broken the steward was handing out landing cards to certain passengers and they should have just informed the people over the intercom to identify themselves if they needed one i had to call out to them and then comes a volley of questions are you a foreign national etc why do they care we know we need to fill it this is not the first time we are traveling to india the only major change i find after tata takeover is that the stewards uniform has changed from red to blue and the pilot has become chatty,0

AirIndia,7.0,great value for money,V Atwal,2022-11-19,i had found this fare which came at a discount and thought of considering it the check in was done properly and the last time i travelled on the airline post the tata takeover they had reduced the meal service so was skeptical over what the meal service was going to be like on this flight because the last time i travelled only a sandwich as provided the boarding started on time however the pushback got delayed by 30 mins due to the congestion at mumbai airport which is the norm i was also pleased to note that the ground staff offered me an extra legroom seat which was greatly appreciated for the breakfast service i was pleasantly surprised as they were offering full breakfasts with both vegetarian as well as non vegetarian fares whereas previously only vegetarian was offered the cutleries stainless steel instead of plastic which was a great touch for the vegetarian fayre it consisted of idlis poha croissant as well as mango yogurt along with tea  coffee which was great the arrival was delayed by 30 minutes but overall this was great value for money as i had got an extra legroom seat a full breakfast with steel cutleries and good staff and crew service i will be flying the return leg soon and im confident of receiving similar service so much appreciated,1

AirIndia,1.0,do not fly with them,Coline Coessens,2022-08-07,3 hours delayed already 7 hours prior to the actual time absolutely no customer service no sense of help no sense of compensation we were shocked i do believe this stays a business client kind purchase and that at least some understanding comes with it couldn’t believe my eyes no help no nothing only answer this is not in our policy… so basically airline with no policy and no human interacting do not fly with them,0
AirIndia,1.0,this is the worst airline,Isha Thakur,2022-08-07,this is the worst airline also the airhostess were very rude i booked business class tickets the seats were completely uncomfortable i had requested for 1 extra blanket for my back and they refused the staff member said 1 person will get only one and the staff were using 3 blankets to sleep on the seats also they had curtains closed in the middle row the staff occupied all the seats in the middle row to sleep  how can the staff sleep in customer area business class facilities the staff were using there is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers its waste of money also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure when i claimed i didn’t get any compensation they are rude and worst airline the staff is very unprofessional,0
AirIndia,2.0,it was a horror show,D Meares,2022-08-07,thinking of an air india flight with long stopover in delhi it was a horror show yes a 19hr stop allows for multihour delays ours was 475 late leaving sydney so they boarded us just before theyd have to give compensation to sit there if you book a hotel and organise a transit evisa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown the transit official confiscated my next boarding pass i had to argue to retrieve my bag tag which was a good thing as i suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised the delay meant id missed the last train then i couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was kafkaesque since i was already checked in no infection control wipes on the plane 2 special meals didn’t arrive entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots though i had printouts confirming my 3rd to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit xray no other airlines have this policy and mine was summarily confiscated in delhi you cant take things that fly on the aeroplane — seriously that was their rationale nice flight attendants sydney to delhi though  33 legroom was the only redeeming feature lastly unforgivably i discovered they fly right over the russian war zone that other airlines avoid whilst using russian oil bought cheaply by india sidestepping embargos french airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that a punishing 30 minute walk between so your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience,0
AirIndia,7.0,i am severely disappointed,E Han,2022-07-09,i had a window seat and the person in the middle seat next to me had a broken screen nothing was done so i just told him that i would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie midway through the flight i was really cold and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants the call button was not working so i tried flashing my light from my cell phone but nobody was minding me eventually the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket unfortunately all blankets had already run out the good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me also after being served peanuts the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on however the cabin crew was not implementing this i have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now i just wish air india would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously in addition to this my seat and table were not exactly very clean see attached photos as a star alliance member i am severely disappointed,1
AirIndia,8.0,surprisingly had a pleasant experience,Ramesh Vureti,2022-07-09,after having flown on various airlines including qatar singapore british airways air france and delta i finally decided to fly with air india for the first time from bengaluru to singapore via mumbai the total journey was roughly 10 hours and surprisingly had a pleasant experience likes legroom  had better legroom compared to other airlines  food  provided food in both the flights which is not an option with most other airlines  well behaved staff  on time baggage availability  value for money  use of minimal plastic cutlery dislikes  there should have been an entertainment system at least in the international flights would have been added advantage  seat cushion and comfort can be improved,1
AirIndia,2.0,wouldnt choose to fly with air india,Eleanor Vear,2022-07-09,they are beyond unbelievable not only are the workers clueless and rude once we were able to board our flight after many difficulties this airline caused we were disgusted the mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable  only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate we received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together well at least for my friend and i because were nervous on planes they were unable to do that for us and we all sat in completely different seats  when we made a complaint and tried to switch seats they kept dismissing us i most certainly wouldnt choose to fly with air india,0
AirIndia,1.0,relates to my lost luggage,A Kajay,2022-07-09,onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work this also applies in business class one might think its a fault so theyll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not i have found this issue continuously my negative review with air india really relates to my lost luggage there are no words to explain the misery i went through with air india in trying to retrieve my bag at heathrow i was given a pir property regularity report and a authority to claim delayed baggage form which i filled in alongside this i was told my bag would be back within 35 days and was given a online tracking link in this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents this is just one example i wrote several emails to air india and although i had responses none of them answered my question all responses were exactly the same standard giving me different links furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered after 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a air india flight back to heathrow the bag never arrived i only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days  basically my mornings were wasted this happened four times it is only when i built up a decent relationship at heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally i called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered when the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it  a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to heathrow i got to heathrow to get in to the baggage area is another story and opened up my bag to find many things missing  thankfully some of the missing items were located thanks to the gentleman at heathrow who understood my situation at delhi airport they advised they wouldnt post it and someone had to collect it with the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items however without the connections i would have had to travel to delhi and no doubt would have been harassed in my opinion air india has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down i have seen more negative reviews for air india than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and dont ignore them but rather take them on board,0
AirIndia,1.0,horrible horrible airline,Harmeet Singh,2022-07-09,singapore to delhi flight got cancelled after making us wait for 45 minutes at the boarding gate flight rescheduled to next day and information about the flight came at 10 pm in the night made us wait for 1 hour at delhi airport inside the aircraft horrible seat with no cushioning in spite of paying additional sgd30 for the seat return flight from delhi also got cancelled on the day of departure few hours before departure i had to pay double the amount to buy another airline ticket in order to fly back to singapore horrible horrible airline,0
AirIndia,1.0,the worst customer service,A Marjash,2022-07-09,me and my husband travelled to india on april 18th 2021 due to national lockdown the airlines were not operational on may 27th the day of return we called air india to cancel the return flight and we were told that we will receive a partial refund it has been over an year i have send over 20 emails to multiple email ids of air india and called several times to ai customer service this is the worst customer service several times the telephone operator hung up on me saying they are connecting me to their manager,0
AirIndia,2.0,cabin crew service was very rude,Amin Virani,2022-07-09,my flight from delhi to toronto was 15 hrs tv was not working and i asked cabin crew and they said many of our tv is not working imagine 15 hrs flight with no tv and cabin crew service was very rude i am not going to travel with air india anymore and my family and friends,0
AirIndia,1.0,the worst airline,P Martak,2022-07-09,visakhapatnam to delhi air india is the worst airline and a big shame to our country their staff members are rude and unprofessional after flight booking i found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket so i called customer support but its hours long wait time then i tried us number which was picked up by a rude person who couldnt communicate in english or hindi either there was no resolution over the call before takeoff safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand landing was very hard on touchdown after landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt hence we checked with air india ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyones luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport the airline was managed by indian government earlier as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease hope a positive change would come in future,0
AirIndia,1.0,rude unhelpful and unapologetic,L Marsden,2022-07-09,myself and my wife were supposed to fly to leh from delhi this morning after showing up to our flight at 445am 2 hours before the departure weve been told by the airline staff that we could not fly because of overbooking weve been told that we would need to find an alternative means of transport this was at the checkin counters after challenging it and asking to be rebooked to another flight they said there was nothing they could do when we showed up at the service counter they told us that we were late for our flight which simply was not true the flight was indeed overbooked the staff were extremely rude unhelpful and unapologetic on top of not being able to get to our destination we now have to fight for a refund this is a seriously bad customer service,0

AirIndia,1.0,overall a poor experience,Amit Kumar Sanghi,2022-05-21,this travel in air india economy is the worst experience their ground staff service has improved however cabin service is poor food amount and service modified to do cost saving seats are uncomfortable and not a pleasant travel seats were dirty and pockets were filled with trash plane landed on time luggage arrived 50 minutes later overall a poor experience,0
AirIndia,1.0,first and last air india experience,Amandeep Singh,2022-05-21,i was very disappointed by bad client service experience from delhi airport by air india team first thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same g counter there was not just paris flight register counter it was with paris new york  toronto flight baggage counter  so there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags and when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes  then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process we asked air india employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we cant do anything then when we finished the security check and ran towards our gate air india employee call us to come fast to boarding gate we said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and cant let us in we missed our flight after that when i ask air india employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot  i asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault but they said its completely your fault and we cant do anything for you my wife was ill she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them i asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets not a refund not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € we paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs after that i asked them any help to at least a stay in hotel for waiting time but they said no we cant do anything for me its the first and last air india experience,0
AirIndia,8.0,found the flights enjoyable,A Nambiar,2022-05-21,the flights were relatively economical and more importantly available for the days i sought i was very pleasantly surprised perhaps having low initial expectations was part of it perhaps it is a reflection of the privatisation of ai but i found the flights enjoyable the boeing 787s were showing a bit if age the ife was limited but the service was top notch the crew were brilliant food was great i will definitely be travelling with ai again,1
AirIndia,1.0,only 10 of the screens started working,Freny Zaveri,2022-05-21,before you call ai customer service  grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process you need to call ai customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service not even basic greetings the rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly couple of times i asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual once you have your basic itinerary ready they will transfer you to billing department which can take only amex or visa card they do have few other options like net banking indian credit cards etc when you are ready to pay ai representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment  90 of the time that doesnt work with that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours so you keep on trying to pay then i put my credit card information and my india address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened my payment was accepted and here i am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company finally after all this i had a ticket to travel before the flight i updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information the website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again btw they don’t have separate line for tsa approve either on the airport it is one common line at newark airport ewr finally we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal the air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a childs meal so unfortunately we dont have an extra childs meal i am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so i convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal i had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck the flight was boeing 777 old plane which has no wifi everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working the whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system after that only 10 of the screens started working now on a 14 hour long flight you dont have wifi or screen the people who already downloaded from home are very smart in short have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight finally we made it to india and felt now everything will be fine but my misery continued while coming back from vadodara to newark as we reached vadodara airport all looks good easy going all documents verified and here i am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge the rep is saying  mam all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass did he say had written boarding pass i was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security wont let me pass the ai rep is no mam it happens sometimes and they know you please go ahead as i reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass the officer was looking at me as though i am an alien and had i issued a handwritten pass to myself ai supposed to inform airport security about this so i can have easy transition but knowing ai they didnt bother to inform the security when i said firmly that its between ai and airport security finally ai security showed up and resolved the issue,0
AirIndia,1.0,none of the tvs worked and no wifi,Amber Teufel,2022-05-21,my husband and i were traveling on ai126 on 07 april 2022 when we left a tablet we reported this to the service counter for air india in the  delhi airport before 5pm approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at delhi airport however they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5 i explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldnt return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning i even asked if i could pay to have it shipped to me in the states she said she couldnt help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed then once i returned to the states there was no one working the air india counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call i called the air india number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that i had to call the delhi service desk the same one that wouldn’t help me when i was standing there and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me i told him i couldn’t afford to call delhi and that i needed his help and he kept saying no call the airport and then he hung up on me we called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing the plane was terrible seats had no cushions and no room none of the tvs worked and there was no wifi  made for a long 17hr flight the flight crew were rude and wouldnt let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the himalayas and i wanted to see them when boarding delhi to the states you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board full xray scan and everything the machine was malfunctioning and so they made all 400 of us stand in line waiting for an hour while they figured out they had to plug it in and we took off late because of it no communication about it at all,0
AirIndia,2.0,i will never fly with air india again,Sandeep Bhola,2022-05-21,my wife had a carry on for her self and diaper bag for a 7 months old baby we were harrased right before the boarding that diaper bag is not allowed she could either bring her carry on or diaper bag i showed this person from the air india website that a personal item is allowed other than carry on such as laptop or diaper bag and threatened us that he will not let us take this flight that was the end of discussion very rude staff i will never fly with air india again ever also for both inbound and outbound flights my in flight entertainment screen was broken imagine travelling 14 hours straight without screen,0

AirIndia,1.0,terrible customer support,Zaheda Saiyed,2022-04-30,my flight from toronto to delhi was rescheduled without my knowledge i learned that the flight was rescheduled to the next day after arriving at the airport airport staff had no idea of timing for the flight and i wasnt even provided a boarding pass after that i tried to call air india constantly for eight hours and every single person kept me on hold for 30 minutes and hung up later terrible customer support next day i reached the airport early morning as i wasnt told about the time waited for 15 hours and i was told the flight is at midnight i was provided a boarding pass for toronto to delhi and no confirmation for my connecting flight from delhi to vadodara i waited at toronto airport for 20 hours and flight took off at 4am in the morning after i reached delhi they said we cant give you any flight as your scheduled flight departed 2 days ago the airport staff were extremely rude and started shouting i waited another 16 hours at delhi airport for a connecting flight no one was sorry no apologies and lot of disappointment wasted four days of my trip and my marriage had to postpone because of terrible service from air india my other six friends travelled around same week and everyone was tortured like this,0
AirIndia,1.0,left stranded with very little options,S Kamalaya,2022-04-30,our flight route was from washington dc iad to bengaluru via delhi on 27th april ‘22 the scheduled stopover was 25 hours in which we had to complete immigration check out baggage  go through customs and recheck in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to bengaluru there was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in delhi so we had roughly only about 15 hours to complete the above steps unfortunately although we were able to finish all the required steps by 130 pm which was the scheduled departure time we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off what followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller we are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items we received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials we were exited out of the airport which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage we had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as airindia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to bengaluru the next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening we were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us we even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price 27k per ticket they’ve denied even giving that to us we were left stranded with very little options we stayed at the airport all day looking for options fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage we finally reached bengaluru around 230 am ironically this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed srinagar flight glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay i fail to understand why air india could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage in all we ended spending 70k for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours did air india sell our tickets to others what could be the reason  immigration  priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings you might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight baggage claim based on your familygroup it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out we lost a lot of time here there was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage  customs and check in luggage while checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers there should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage we lost a lot of time here security check again domestic and international passengers need to have different lines travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited,0
AirIndia,1.0,entertainment screen wasnt working,J Fernandez,2022-04-30,the aircraft is spacious enough but thats not all customers would prefer i used air india to fly from dubai to delhi and return and both ways the entertainment screen wasnt working on my way back the armrest was damaged after paying in full this is not what a customer would like to experience,0

AirIndia,3.0,did not have pillows for passengers,H Karshar,2022-04-04,the inflight entertainment was not working they did not have pillows for passengers and you literally had to ask them for blankets as it was very cold in the aircraft food was not up to standard cabin staff were good,0
AirIndia,1.0,never again air india in my life,Joseph Cherian,2022-04-04,as i entered the air india aircraft boeing 777 there was no fresh smell but a sensation of stale air during the 15hour flight none of the tv screens was working the announcement was made over the public address system that the tv screens were faulty for which they apologized  ac too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy none of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services  throughout the flight people were walking up and down the aisle to fetch water for lunch they also included the snack meant for tea so crew can be spared the trouble of serving again at tea time the flight was so deplorable that i cancelled my return trip to vancouver by air india and booked on lufthansa instead even though i had to lose a substantial amount of money never again air india in my life,0
AirIndia,1.0,a totally chaotic experience,C Kathir,2022-04-04,it was a totally chaotic experience no web check in from vancouver as it is not in the drop down listi called customer service and the poor lady could not help me much the flight is totally basic no inflight entertainment whatsoever the seats are broken and dirty no reading light or call button thankfully i was forewarned so i had downloaded movies for kids on their computers i had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this i did not get the chosen seats this was frustrating nor will i get repaid for the extra fare i paid as now i dont have time to run after them the heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling when i asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60 finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch the thermostat was not working the saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves they commiserated with us as they were not responsible for the poor quality provided by ai the lady next to me helped me with my frustrated tired kids on the whole i would not recommend this flight new management has a huge task ahead of them,0
AirIndia,5.0,the food was the worst i’ve ever had,Jay Gupta,2022-04-04,i realize that tatas have a huge task ahead of them to set the airline on a proper trajectory however my experience was not bad except the food which was the worst i’ve ever had the staff were excellent and the overall flight was very comfortable and on time,1
AirIndia,1.0,absolute worst flight experience,S Kaur,2022-04-04,absolute worst flight experience the aircraft was so old and broken down the seats were super uncomfortable most of the tvs did not work the staff was extremely rude and did their job horribly when i complained about the tv not working they did nothing to help the overhead lights and assistance buttons also did not work when i asked for water they told me to go to the back and get it myself the bathrooms were disgusting no toilet paper or hand sanitizer travellers were not even provided basic toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste even though it was a 16 hour flight i will never be travelling on this airline again and do not recommend anyone else to either,0
AirIndia,1.0,an alternative flight was also not arranged,N Singh,2022-04-04,our flight was cancelled at 1230 when all customers were waiting for boarding which is unacceptable and an alternative flight was also not arranged which is completely zero tolerance refund is not the solution for this as we have value for our time an alternative should have been kept in case of technical issues,0
AirIndia,3.0,most mediocre business class,A Sahyra,2022-04-04,i travelled in ai 309 melbourne to new delhi it’s one of the most mediocre business classes i ever travelled in it is more like glorified premium economy some airlines premium economy is better than business class of air india  enough legroom and comfortable but zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you no storage whatsoever charging points not working if you chose the windows seat then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping inflight entertainment the inflight entertainment is laughable if you are not indian you will have like 10 movies to chose from tv shows have only one episode no music to listen to food its typical indian food be prepared for that service they server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice you will be asked for drinks twice only cost it was slightly cheaper than other business class when i say slightly 1200aud less than other flights and i chose it which is clearly a mistake will not recommend this carrier,0
AirIndia,1.0,doesnt care in the least about customer service,C Thane,2022-04-04,i am horrified ive never been treated so badly in my entire life i showed up for my flight 3 hours early when i went to check in i was asked if i had filled out the air suvidha form i had not as i had not been notified by air india that this form was required and i looked all over their website and found no mention of this form i have been to india 4 times before and knew to have all my pertinent documents with me which i did but nobody told me i had to upload them to a special website filling out the form was impossible to do on a cell phone i couldnt get the documents to be small enough so the form kept being rejected there was nobody there helping all the people who had not filled out the form because none of them were notified in advance there were a half dozen of us that were not permitted to check in because we were unable to complete the form on our cell phones among those turned away were an elderly couple and a young couple with an infant baby this is totally unconscionable the couple with the infant baby asked if they could at least be compensated with a hotel room and the heartless air india employee behind the counter said sorry there is nothing we can do for you then to add insult to injury when trying to rebook the flight air india is charging a 300 no show fee this airline doesnt care in the least about customer service i will never book a flight with air india again do yourself a favor and book with a different airline,0
AirIndia,7.0,in flight meal was good,Rahul Anand,2022-03-13,now after take over by tata change is visual when flying air india did web checkin and no check in baggage so no experience of check in boarding was smooth also flown on time and arrived on time in flight meal was good though now they should start serving non veg in economy class too which was stopped by management few years back staff were courteous,1
AirIndia,1.0,sublime torture on this 155 hour journey,S Shetty,2022-03-13,i have often heard of horror stories of international travel in air india but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route however due to a personal emergency i had to fly air india recently since it was the only way i could get to chicago in time air india has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 155 hour journey the tortuous checkin process with agents taking upto 1520 minutes to checkin a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board the aircraft was rundown and shabby which was the second warning but the best part was when i reached my seat i had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that i could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 45 seats had a working ife system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the air india logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway the seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests i have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that i never have to sit in this seat again this was not the end of it of course the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 245 am it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in checkin and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 56 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible after this the crew decided to rest for 67 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own teacoffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said teacoffee in perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the ife could not finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard the only redeeming factor on the flight was that air india is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight it did not alleviate the misery in any way the first thing i did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way i can put myself through such an experience again,0
AirIndia,1.0,no entertainment on 16 hr flight,P Vardel,2022-03-13,worst flight i travelled ever my flight was of 16 hrs non stop and the screen in front of me was not working at all i was not able to watch any safety protocols or see where the flight is currently route weather conditions no entertainment on the 16 hrs flight it felt like i was in a black hole or something like that i requested the flight attendants to turn the screen on or change the seat if the screen is broken and they responded in humiliating and disrespectful way and did nothing  if the screen was not working why did you allotted the seat to me it was very unfair with me,0
AirIndia,1.0,worst flight experience ever,Urvashie Pruthi,2022-03-13,worst flight experience ever the chairs were broken one couldn’t recline and other won’t stop reclining there was a chewing gum just in front of my seat no regular service ring the bell and nobody will come for hours and eventually you have to go get water and everything you want the armrest was broken as shown in the photo here they have screen but earphones don’t work i asked for a cup of tea i was told we are serving food right now so later will bring it after an hour i went again n was told sorry now we can’t give you anything as we will land in one hour and we forgot to bring before the whole crew was sitting in the back chilling,0
AirIndia,1.0,no proper accommodation provided,Dhaval Patel,2022-03-13,my wifes with my infant flight was delayed 5 hrs from the actual arrival time so the domestic connecting flight missed and next flight after 10 hrs at the airport no food and no proper accommodation provided because of their mismanagement and my wife had to sit the whole night with luggage and our 8month child at the delhi airport complaint on the airlines website but after 15 months also no acknowledgment of their mistakes nor a simple reply back,0
AirIndia,1.0,do not recommend anyone to fly air india,Bhakti Panchal,2022-03-13,we had purchased a business class seat for my mother as she recently had major surgeries and her legs needed to stay elevated throughout the journey the seat recline didnt work the entire time the seat was normal as an economy class the main reason for us to buy the biz class for the comfort of her travel which was not the case here at all i have try calling ai since last three days no answer if you try to book the flight the calls goes through immediately but if you call for any other reason no one ever picks up i have submitted an online feedback no respond i have sent an email no response we were told by the crew member that since she had an issue with her seat she would get a refund back but how will one get a refund if there is no way to contact anyone  this was waste of our money i do not recommend anyone to fly air india,0
AirIndia,1.0,plane was filthy  entertainment non existent,Anisha Judge,2022-03-13,i had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from san francisco to delhi on feb 21st the ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel i knew that there was something amiss when i tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent of course true to air india’s style there was no way to get through to an agent when i arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager this is where the rudeness and complete disregard started the staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states you have 2 options you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy  when i said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with then i cant help you as i have to give your seat to a paying passenger and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem when i refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger completely ignoring me as if i did not exist i kept talking and she completely ignored me i was also informed that she was the only manager and that i had no recourse imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in i then walked over to the united counter to try to see if i could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me i explained my situation to the united manager who then contacted air india at this time i realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site it took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible air india manager out of her office she stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to not my original seat was manually functional ie broken but could be moved manually i had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer when i got on board i did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional at this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers i have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken she was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14a and 14c  anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken they finally moved me to another partially broken seat this seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the faa rules were broken during take off and landing finally the plane was filthy the entertainment non existent and the food terrible anyway i made my way to delhi in complete misery,0
AirIndia,1.0,waiting for refund since last 1 year,Satheesh Kottayil,2022-03-13,bangalore to muscat please dont travel in this airline i have been waiting for refund around 12000rs since last 1 year every time when we call customer care they will tell some stories,0
AirIndia,10.0,a great short flight,Ankit Dubey,2022-03-13,this was my first time flying air india after its acquisition by its founding owners tatas and to be honest i wasnt expecting much of a change in the hard product given the turnaround of the interiors etc would take time and i would give them at least a year to refurbish their entire fleet and replace older planes with newer ones however i did expect to see changes in the soft product like ground staff cabin crew inflight meals and most importantly the on time performance i was very impressed with the overall time management of the ground staff who ensured on time boarding the cabin crew was courteous and ensured that all the pax wore masks for the entire duration of the flight air india offers free refreshments or meals on a short 60 minute flight like this one so i was served a refreshment box with a veg puff tetra juice pack tomato ketchup and and the crew was kind enough to serve me another snack box when i requested overall it was a great short flight and would fly them again,1
AirIndia,1.0,not recommend anybody to travel with them,Sukhjinder Singh,2022-03-13,traveling with air india get worse and worse they dont provide pillow and blankets they dont serve soft drinks hard drink tea or coffee on seat you have to go the service station sometime passengers dont know and they wait all the time for drinks like me and didnt announce that for snacks they serve that 10rupees bread cold sandwich and  breakfast quality is ok when you ask them for these things they give excuse of covid so from my experience i would not recommend anybody to travel with them,0
AirIndia,1.0,customer care support is worst,Anjan Yaragani,2022-01-16,i will never book ticket with air india they cancelled the flight 12 hours before and scheduled it two days later again they canceled 12 hours before second time and scheduled to next day customer care support is worst and they just keep your call in hold more than hour and simply cut the call without details and also they never call back even mentioned to give a call back if call dropped in between i had to call 5 times to speak with customer care support and it took more than 5 hours worst management and they dont care about customer satisfaction i am not going to travel with air india,0
AirIndia,1.0,haven’t been able to refund me,Cécilia Lopez,2022-01-16,during the summer of 2020 i wasn’t able to take the plane because of covid and my 700€ ticket still to this day hasn’t been refunded i have called and waited and spent so much energy on this company but they took me for a fool and still haven’t been able to refund me their service company is horrible and several times they have hung up on me while i was waiting never ever buy a ticket from them as you will never be paid back if you do not take the plane,0
AirIndia,1.0,told now the change fee had increased,Sekh Mallik,2022-01-16,i had to transit through delhi and was asked to do a repeat pcr in spite of already holding a negative pcr report from my first flight by the time i got the test done in the airport i lost my connection i approached the desk of air india and was told there was a later flight and i need to pay 3000 inr to get into that flight i arranged to pay but they asked to see the negative report of the new test when i brought the report i was told now the change fee had increased to 4500 rupees in desperation i agreed but was told they would only change the flight after i brought the luggage that was checked on the earlier flight i got my luggage and as expected the counter staff of air india told me now the change fee had become 7000 rupees i was desperate to reach my destination and paid it but i dread to even think the plight of those who were wailing at the counters since they did not have the means to pay,0
AirIndia,1.0,never travel with air india again,Lovlit Goplani,2022-01-16,never travel with air india again firstly they cancelled the flight a day before and never even bothered to inform us as we had already checked in they took our boarding pass and gave as a new one which stated a night flight after such long wait and discussion back then they shifted us on the next day morning flight later when we were there they emphasised on rtpcr even after having double vaccination certificate and rude staff was so keen on making our experience worst stating dont keep the bag like this keep like that as if we were the porters for her,0
AirIndia,5.0,booking a ticket online is such a pain,Anjan Mandal,2022-01-16,booking a ticket online is such a pain i tried booking online from australia and everytime the payment failed then i tried booking via the tickets via their 24 hrs helpline and i had to call their call center multiple times for a total duration of 5 hrs before i could finally book the tickets for every call the call center agent verifies the details again and then transfers the call to the ticketing team for booking cancellations rescheduling and refunds but then the call gets disconnected invariably after 30 mins i faced this same issue when i tried to reschedule my return domestic flight as my original flight was cancelled why can we not access the direct line to the ticketing team when are actually choosing that option while calling the call center i think this is the biggest pain please fix this i will not prefer to travel with air india unless i am in a pinch online booking and call center delays are the biggest two issues which will keep the customer away so please fix this,0
AirIndia,6.0,i would say to not fly air india ,Somik Sinha,2022-01-16,san francisco to delhi everything went pretty smoothly from check in to boarding however the flight wasn’t the best the ifes barely worked so we didn’t have entertainment for nearly 56 hours until they fixed it the seats were also very uncomfortable so i barely got any sleep the cabin crew was friendly and the meals were nice i would say to not fly air india for international travel,0
AirIndia,1.0,absolute horrendous experience,Ajay Maru,2022-01-16,please do not use air india unless its an absolute emergency 80 9f their inflight entertainment systems dont work this is for an international flight of 15 hours baggage check in take 2 hours at a minimum there was incorrect communication on baggage transfers and people lost their bags absolute horrendous experience,0
AirIndia,6.0,boarding delay and nothing but chaos,Ash Walker,2022-01-16,ease of booking no problem except the travel agent could not insert your frequent flyer number if outside of air india during ticket booking had to do so at the time of check in to ensure that the united frequent flyer was printed on the boarding pass air india should ensure that any star alliance number can be inserted into the booking checkin almost trouble free  the staff at toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and rtpcr test results staff must be trained to insert the frequent flyer number from other star alliance airlines boarding delay and nothing but chaos there was no separate queue for business class the counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time smooth flight great boeing 777  and great meals however after the first 2 hours the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not restocked extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew very helpful to the families with kids and senior citizens air india lounge at delhi airport with very little supplies and hardly any variety of food cramped space during the pandemic i flew from delhi to mumbai after the 14 hour flight from toronto to delhi it was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by air india nonflying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes my own business class seat was changed in favor of a captains daughter flying on the flight air india can do much better by not disturbing or bumping around paying passengers in favor of nonpaying ones delhi airport crowd management can be improved a lot especially during these pandemic times,1
AirIndia,1.0,there is absolutely no clue what is going on,Narendran Pillai,2022-01-16,the flight was supposed to take off by 1150am however even at 345pm almost 4hrs now there is absolutely no clue what is going on still awaiting any announcements about when we would take off to make it worse even the crew or pilot cant make any meaningful announcements to let people know of the condition absolutely radio silence except for all kids screaming and people impatiently walking about did i mention broken display so no entertainment either,0

AirIndia,1.0,not worth the money at all,H Kaur,2021-12-02,worst customer service experience ever called 4 times and spoke to 7 different customer service representatives about changing my ticket but as soon as i confirmed the change and was about to pay the representative would cut my call this didnt happen once or twice but four times in one day i told the latter representatives that i urgently needed to change my ticket and could not keep calling back and being transferred but they kept doing the same thing due to this the ticket availability went from 9th december to 1st january 2022 and when i finally was able to book the 1st of jan the representative cut my call again horrible airlines with horrible customer service and not worth the money at all,0
AirIndia,10.0,good experience on this short sector,D Kabey,2021-12-02,i was impressed with the legspace even on this small aircraft though air india usually offers snacks on even short flights but due to covid it was not available on this flight water bottles were served to all passengers flight was on time and landed a few minutes before arrival time overall a good experience on this short sector and thankful to air india for being the only airline to be operating on this route and that too at a reasonable price,1
AirIndia,1.0,customer support has been absolutely pathetic,J Kultin,2021-12-02,i flew air india on a singleleg domestic flight of less than an hour unfortunately air india lost my luggage on this flight while i understand that accidents like these happen on any airline air indias customer support has been absolutely pathetic ever since calls to generic customer support lines that can be found online either dont work or connect to someone who cannot help after waiting for long periods the specific phone numbers i received to the team handling my case at goa airport do not answer to my calls or messages even confirmed that they do answer when called from a different number so i strongly suspect them of ignoring my specific phone number at this point it has been almost two weeks since losing my bag and a week since i last managed to get through to air india despite daily attempts to do so in short this experience with customer service is extremely frustrating and having to deal with them has made my trip much worse than it had to be without luggage apart from not having much confidence in air india trying to return my luggage to me my attempts to get compensated for 1 additional expenses made for new clothing and toiletries and 2 for the value of the bag if not found after 21 days has been frustrating as well i was instructed at the airport to send my receipts to an email address specific to the goa team after which my case would get updated with them and id retrieve the compensation by picking it up in cash at any global air india office unsurprisingly i have not heard back on this email address after a week and even if the compensation would have been honored in my case the idea of having to physically go to an office after i leave india is bonkers in my many desperate attempts to get any sign of life on my case from air india the only place where they have been sort of responsive is through twitter but even they do not seem to be able to get an update from the luggage team actually handling my case concluding i would advise everyone to avoid air india at all cost as any circumstance in which youd have to deal with their customer support will be extremely frustrating while i would expect nonbudget national carriers and star alliance members offer some basic level of service this is not at all the case for air india,0
AirIndia,1.0,worst experience with this airline,Lilesh Karade,2021-12-02,recently i traveled with air india and experienced a worst experience with this airline we were travelling from mumbai to goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 km to terminal 2 the flight was at 9 pm and we reached at the desk at 815 pm the air india personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in it was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal later i have checked with many passengers who informed me that the airline portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal finally all the personnel to whoever i spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport and made sure that i should not board in the flight another harassment started when i went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of air india the booking officer on other side of the glasswindow was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made i kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to goa he somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls i asked him what is happening  to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets after five minutes i lost my patience and left the window secondly their call centres are closed after 1800 hrs a recorded message will be heard continuously after 1800 hrs that you are in queue but no one will respond from the other side nor the ivr facility will be available i travelled with indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable in similar situation at chandigarh airport when i reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight they made sure that i boarded in the flight with my family their personnel accompanied me from entrance of the airport up to the flight now i can understand why this airline is in losses from so many years the attitude of the staff is sinking this boat,0
AirIndia,1.0,the worst experience,Manav Joshi,2021-12-02,flight departure time was 1155am which was delayed to 155pm passengers were allowed to board flight at 1pm pilot found some technical issue at the last moment and could not be fixed in 9 hours it is 915pm i am still on the flight which has not taken off passengers were provided a meal once only and status updates were not given frequently which left people clueless and frustrated in terms of interior seats cant be pushed back more than an inch screens not functioning properly provided meal was also tasteless overall the worst experience when i asked an attendant to provide water she said it was kept in the galley get it from there blanket and cushion is not provided in flight i would be inclined towards zero rating for all criteria,0

AirIndia,1.0,i never recommend air india to anyone,M R Raghunath,2021-12-02,worst experience in my life time the flight was supposed to be a direct flight from bangalore to hyderabad at 650pm on 13th nov 2021 suddenly a text message on the morning of the 13th that the boarding time is at 0310pm its the first shock reached airport leaving all my day plans later the flight started around 400pm one more shock on the plane is its via kolhapur in a very bad mood we reached kolhapur at 540pm its suppose to leave by 550pm the kolhapur staff were informed by the airline staff that they have to take off on or before 550pm again it got delayed and the flight was not started till 615pm suddenly an announcement that the flight cant take off due to bad weather when we can see the stars and the moon clearly so many people had connecting flights to travel abroad they have given back our luggage and not said anything i waited till 830pm with no update at least on next day timings then i left to catch a bus to hyderabad couldnt and had to come back to bangalore my return from hyderabad is on 14th nov 2021 at 0815pm i have planned for a day to attend my clients place everything has gone in vain i never recommend air india to anyone,0
AirIndia,2.0,the most disappointing experience,N Shah Jenkins,2021-12-02,i had my first experience with air india recently and i have to say it has been up there as possibly the most disappointing experience i have ever had in summary if you have a choice  please choose another proper airline this was a flight long haul from london to bombay the ticket was booked in economy and upgraded to business class using fr miles prior to flying i needed to contact customer services and this was a nightmare i wasted hours of my time trying to call them i managed to get through to one person who when i explained the problem just shouted back what’s the problem what’s the problem then he put me on hold and a different man who was more well spoken answered and then lied to me that he was going to arrange a video call back in 2h very confusing that he would say that and not try to help me and not collect any of my personal details i never did receive any support and when calling back the telephone queue was like a prank call with the queue position going up and down like a yoyo shocking beyond terrible but the worst part is those lies from customer services that really damages air india’s credibility with me anyway i went to the airport i was concerned about extra check during covid times so i arrived 35 hours before departure air india refused to allow me to check in early despite the business counter being in use by economy passengers now i know i was early so partially my fault however at one stage other bom passengers were being allowed to join the economy queue while i had to wait for be allowed to go to the business class checkin by the time i checked in there was one bom economy passenger i recognised that reached the counter before me business class is meant to be a premium product to take the hassle and stress out of travelling or add a little luxury i travel in economy for personal travel about 99 of the time as we all have bills to pay however when i upgrade to business class i expect to enjoy it and see the benefit after this ordeal i was able to enjoy at the lounge facilities at london heathrow luckily it was a star alliance lounge run by another airline phew i’m glad it wasn’t an air india lounge lest i would be subjected to further torture at the boarding gate more fun and games i’m afraid one giant mess of a queue to have temperature readings before going to the boarding desk this meant there was no discernible difference between economy and business class passengers just one big line to wait in more stress and hassle which was supposed to be avoided on the plane as expected a tired cabin outdated infotainment the seat was comfortable but lacking some adjustment options the infotainment screen was low resolution and difficult to use compared with modern equivalents on proper airlines such as etihad the business class cabin is what you would expect on a shorter haul flight such as 45h not a 9h flight i will write a complaint to air india i don’t expect to receive anything back,0
AirIndia,2.0,services have downgraded tremendously,Jyoti Kumari,2021-10-24,services have downgraded tremendously they made all the passengers sit in the flight for about 3040 mins without switching on the air conditioner when customers asked they did nothing about it people were using papers to fan themselves the flight didn’t take off on time or land on time my seat was also changed post boarding while entering the flight manually without my consent like it was a local train when i asked for a reason later they stated it was because i was a solo traveller the staff was also very aggressive in their tone and behaviour,0
AirIndia,2.0,dont have spaceto put my luggage,M Saleemuddin,2021-10-24,i hold a business class ticket for this flight and i was told in the counter of checkin i am the only passenger in business class when i board i see its occupied by the crew members and i dont have space in cabin to put my luggage,0
AirIndia,1.0,bad experience with any airline,Harry Downey,2021-10-24,flight got delayed for 2 times all the passengers who booked for this flight were very upset including me there was no proper announcement when the gate was changed i’ve never seen this kind of bad experience with any airline,0
AirIndia,2.0,would not recommend air india,Nimisha Mehta,2021-10-24,one of the worst experience we had booked our tickets 9th october 2021 to amritsar it was said that we will reach amritsar by 950 am but to our surprise we reached amritsar at 1130 am they had merged our flight with indore and so we went amritsar via indore we had to attend function and thats why we took early flight so that we reach on time we missed our function and also lost all our mood to attend function such irresponsible behaviour of reputed airline is not acceptable they should have informed us so that we could have modified our travel would not recommend air india,0
AirIndia,10.0,a wonderful experience,N Kadey,2021-10-24,it was a short one hour flight and despite having not web checked in the check in officials were prompt to help me with the kiosk machine as i didnt know how to use them one of the most impressive thing about air india is their 25kg luggage allowance the flight was on time and landed before scheduled arrival time though there was no meal service the crew distributed water bottles and safety kits the ife was working well but due to short course of flight i just had the flight tracker on overall a wonderful experience,1
AirIndia,1.0,unprofessional and rude customer service,Anand Vijayakumar,2021-10-24,i contacted air india for ticket cancellation they cancelled the ticket and confirmed that i will receive the refund i booked the ticket through an agency but they asked me to contact air india directly because they said they dont have the cancellation option from their side i cancelled the ticket in april 2021 and waited till oct 2021 for my refund i called them at least 10 to 15 times within this 45 months period every time they say it is in process or they have initiated the refund finally on 14th oct 2021 i called them again and requested the status the lady who picked my call first was so impatient and she forwarded my call to some other department and didnt even wait for me to finish what i was trying to say the next customer service assistant told me they dont have some number required from the booking agency then i asked her why you guys did not tell me this all these days i must have called them at least 1015 times every 2 weeks i used to call i requested her to connect me to the managersupervisor she immediately disconnected the call im an indian but i will try my level best to avoid air india if you are fine dealing with unprofessional and rude customer service go ahead and book your ticket,0
AirIndia,1.0,it has not been refunded,Nagendra Chougule,2021-10-24,never ever book through air india i booked the ticket from delhi to goa on august 2021 and due to some circumstances i have cancelled my ticket before 15 days but i tried to contact customer service to refund my ticket amount but till date it has not been refunded i’m trying call them again and again to collect my refundable amount but they never bother about the customer service,0
AirIndia,10.0,he made sure i was all okay,Nynan Noushad,2021-10-24,on 08102021 i had a flight on airindia from mumbai to hyderabad before the beginning of the flight itself i was feeling tired hyperventilating and was sick the air steward came to help and assisted me cleaning up he offered me and the nearby passenger change in seats throughout the journey this steward gave me company whilst doing his duties he made me drink water every half an hour and offered me biscuits at the end of the trip he made sure i was all okay,1
AirIndia,1.0,most terrible experience ever,G Palaya,2021-10-24,one of the worst flight ever with the worst ever staff we booked an air india flight to goa but the flight was horrible so was the ground staff as well as the people sitting at the reception there was an 11 month baby with us at the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else but they did not cooperate the air india website is so so poor this is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in i have traveled so many times before each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasnt the case with this airline rather we got the last seat of the airline ie the seat near the washroom it was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us again while coming back from goa the same thing happened the same seats were allotted i called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call after 25 mins one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude she said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that i tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side while calling the air india customer care even if u are in a queue your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down the staff was highly rude and no cooperative and it was a terrible experience the mother with the infant wasnt given any preference for the seat even after requesting them it was one of the most terrible experience ever,0
AirIndia,1.0,it was a nightmare,Gurjit Nijjar,2021-10-24,i had connecting flight of air india from amritsar to delhi from delhi i had international flight to vancouver air india was delayed by 2 hours then they said flight is delayed by another 3 hours later they said flight is cancelled there was no bad weather or any adverse conditions because of them my connecting flight got missed i was traveling with my wife 2 years old girl and 1 year boy whole night we had to spend on airport no accommodation food or refund provided had to purchase 4 new tickets staff at delhi airport was so rude we were crying over there with kids never felt that helpless in my life it was a nightmare,0
AirIndia,1.0,absolute nightmare,K Narani,2021-09-12,absolute nightmare boarding delayed for 15 hours due to technical difficulties and no option to cancelreschedule flight all they said is that they will take care of everyone now that would be spending another night at the airport and wait time of 12 more hours for connecting flight to destination used to be a convenient direct airlines to india but this is such a pathetic and horrifying experience i would never travel again with air india senior citizens with might think it is convenient to travel directly from us to india but on the contrary it is an absolute nightmare,0
AirIndia,1.0,they said that boarding is closed,Jyoti Singh,2021-09-12,air india is worst airline they are just fetching money from its flyers i reached at window 45mins prior to my flight departure and they said that boarding is closed and they cannot do anything with it and we have to book a new ticket and have to pay full amount we cancelled our plan to take next flight but on schedule board it was showing same flight was on boarding stage till 15mins prior to departure there were more people like us,0
AirIndia,1.0,assigned my seat to someone else,R Jahani,2021-09-12,despite having paid extra for a specific seat when i booked the ticked air india staff assigned my seat to someone else after i had checked in for the flight my boarding pass was already printed and given to me with the seat i had chosen at booking but air india staff subsequently assigned my seat to someone else on the plane when i raised the issue the cabin crew and counter staff failed to rectify the situation they then moved me to a demonstrably worse seat one without a tv which all other passengers had mind you this was for a 15hour flight i understand that people sometimes need to have their seats shifted but surely there were others on the plane who hadnt paid for their seats so their seats should be changed not those of us who paid for our seating in addition its outrageous that air india would give my seat to someone else after i checked in and had the my boarding pass with my proper seat number printed on it,0
AirIndia,1.0,there was no hygiene,P Kalesh,2021-09-12,we flew from newark to delhi airport the service provided on the flight was the worst no blanket no pillow no coffeetea nothing as per air hostess the flight was under covidrestriction travel so nothing to be provided to the passengers i dont understand then why they are charging more from us if you dont want to provide us with all amenities if this was a covid flight we expect some cleanliness but there was no hygiene the air hostesses were so rude sometimes they didnt allow us to use some restrooms because of their safety concerns really as we are traveling this doesnt mean that we have covid we all sat on that flight with a negative covid test at least give us some respect i will never recommend,0
AirIndia,1.0,how can this airline treat passengers so casually,Mohit Sharma,2021-09-12,never book any flight with this airline as they have extremely poor service pathetic staff worst customer service and unprofessional behaviour they treat passengers as if they are traveling on a free ride with the airline and have no plans to reach the destination there is no acknowledgement about the delays and no support for refund or reschedule the refund takes more than 6 months sometimes my luggage was damaged and company id was lost while returning from udaipur to mumbai how can this airline treat passengers so casually,0
AirIndia,1.0,amount is not refundable,Anoop Kumar,2021-09-12,air india customer service is unprofessional and customer service numbers are down all the time no update given on their website or info to travel agents i was suppose to cancel my flight to tirupati but as there customer care lines are down i had to call them back next day of my booking since i did not reach out to them 24 hours after the ticket was booked the amount is not refundable stop booking air india rather indigo really helped me with regard to full refund,0
AirIndia,2.0,not refunding the money,J Datesh,2021-09-12,we had booked the tickets online and we could easy book the tickets on the air india website and also got the email confirmation immediately even now it shows that the status as confirmed we went to the airport with all the luggage and all and we came to know that air india flights are not been flying since more than a month now so now why are we allowed to book the tickets when the flights are not flying at all secondly the systems at air india customer care are not at all updated and they have no idea or update of the current status of the flights we would have called at least 10 times and every time they mentioned flight is confirmed and later after several transfer to escalation team and all we get to know that flights are not flying now at maharaja we got the update that the flight is not flying however it is a scam and trying to fool people as till yesterday in maharaja it was showing out name and details for the particular flight but today is says it is cancelled are the website and customer care people not aware of the current status or are they doing it knowingly to collect money from people and not refund itits a big scam going on that too when indian government is involved now when we call for refund we are directed to several teams on the call on long waits and no one is able to give a proper solution not sure if we will ever get the money back really frustrated along with that we also did the rtpcr test which cost around 600 for 3 of us we had given several calls before going for the test just to be sure and conformed and the customer care guys mentioned it is confirmed at the airport we met 4 other families who had booked on the same flight on same date and were facing the same issue i am sure air india is earning a lot from these false booking and not refunding the money people be aware before you choose air india i know these writing and comments doesnt effect air india however just for the knowledge and awareness for people to be cautious and not suffer,0
AirIndia,1.0,good for nothing customer support,E Sanhee,2021-09-12,they will take your money and you will never see it again even if you do your due diligence and cancel within 24 hours even if you call them every other day for 2 month wait on hold for hours write 20 emails and create 5 escalated cases with their sub standard rude and good for nothing customer support agents all of the above happened to me i booked a business class ticket and tried to cancel online but the system was down so i called to cancel within 24 hours but the customer support agent casually said and i quote please call back later the system is undergoing maintenance and i cannot cancel at this time that was my first red flag what kind of an agent cannot cancel even if the user cannot cancel so i left an email asking them to cancel within 24 hours i called several times after that and i got the same response  id have to pay the 200 cancellation charge because the 24 hours has passed otherwise they said its wise to hold off on cancelling until my escalated case would be reviewed by someone at a higher level that the customer agents do not have access to emails because they just dont and only the backend team can see my emails that id get a response within 24 to 48 hours but didnt even if i did it was always automated or tightly scripted was i ever talking to a human exhausted with the constant back and forth and going nowhere for 1 month but before my flight date i called them to cancel my booking agreeing to pay the 200 i was promised that my escalated case would be seen to and id get back my 200 fee but it never was i left them multiple requests in email on their feedback form but talking to these people is like talking to a wall,0

AirIndia,1.0,air india just doesnt care,K Parvar,2021-06-17,the bad experience starts as soon as you enter the airport at the check in desk no availability of onlinecheck in no line management for different types of check in at the counter online after 45 minutes of standing in the queue as there were not enough staff for the number of passengers checking in boarding began with the boarding pass being checked minimum 4 times could never understand why this happens on indian domestic and international flights only no inflight entertainment seats were broken food was the only plus which made the journey bearable overall very disappointed and it seemed from their lacklustre service that air india just doesnt care no improvement during the return leg of the journey from delfra they capitalised on the passengers vulnerabilty during the holidays by putting in service the oldworst serviced planes ps the prices were 15 times the normal prices,0
AirIndia,2.0,seats are not comfortable,N Barden,2021-06-17,very poor food flight is very dirty and seats are not comfortable and even found a panel laying side to the seat entertainment system barely works and dont have any options so it is better not to work they dont do any sort of maintenance inside the flight,0

AirIndia,1.0,the worst customer service,Atiya Panjwani,2021-06-17,the worst customer service we booked a flight for a later date which had to be preponed we called the customer service department and requested to reschedule the flight to a month earlier we paid the fare difference and in spite of all that we were not given the itinerary we called them for three days literally 20 times now they are asking us to pay more amount we requested for full refund and they are only giving us 600 rupees out of 6000 i am going to make sure that i never book any tickets from this airline,0
AirIndia,4.0,nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment,B Mayshek,2021-06-17,i booked the flight mainly because of the cheap fare compared to other airlines due to covid only a few options were available checkin and boarding were smooth they served good food on time however did not serve any drinks coffeetea alcohol it was at the back of the airlines for selfservice cabin crews were good to help the most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment i just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment i would download some movies songs if i knew earlier air india does not provide inflight internet in most of the seats inflight entertainment system was not working touch screens are hardly working on the second leg delhi to kolkata it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainmentinternet service also the air conditioning was not properly working on the ground it was very suffocating after wearing mask and face shield air india is one of the two domestic airlines that provide hot meals but they serve the only veg meal the meals were so so,0
AirIndia,5.0,phone chargers should be available,I Kaur,2021-06-17,flight was okay to travel as we dont have many choices in pandemic staff were helpful however none of the phone chargers were working because they were all broken i was lucky that my phone was charged and did not need to use it in this day and age all information and important documents are on the phone so phone chargers should be available,1
AirIndia,4.0,the product is really sub par,R Pardolan,2021-06-17,after avoiding air india for years i was forced to spend my hard earned money on them for a round trip between iad and maa because of the indian government forbidding sixth freedom traffic under the covid air bubble agreements i had very low expectations and air india was as bad as i feared the indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible every aspect of this trip was subpar and given a choice i cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline here are all the ways in which they were bad 1 their web site is terrible and it wouldnt accept my lufthansa frequent flyer number even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers the web site also wouldnt allow me to request a special meal and it gave absolutely no explanation for why from some google research i realized this might be due to covid precautions 2 i made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues the amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of new delhi railway station for their calls i could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying they supposedly entered my lufthansa number for me but as i could tell when i printed my boarding pass it wasnt entered properly and it didnt work i had to claim my miles via lufthansa after the flight on a separate call the rep took my special meal request and entered it but didnt seem to know or didnt bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during covid 3 my itinerary was iaddelmaa on different b787s for each leg i flew business class and the product is really sub par the seats are grimy the upholstery was torn on one of the legs the seat power didnt work properly worst of all for me the moving maps didnt work on both iaddel and deliad legs also the flat bed isnt long enough for my 63 height the pillow they give is a joke the cabin crew were nice enough but i really didnt like the heavygreasy indian food i was forced to eat on some of the legs the food on the maadel leg even gave me severe digestion problems 4 air india lounges were open in del or maa supposedly due to covid but other private lounges were operating so it seems like covid was just an excuse 5 on a couple positive notes all my flights were on time which was a blessing and the prices of the business class ticket was well below prepandemic business class levels,0
AirIndia,2.0,charged me 5040 rupees for 8kg,Siddaram Ishwaragond,2021-06-17,horrible experience with customer care and staff customer care promised me 30kg as i had next day international flight but they charged me 5040 rupees for 8kg really horrible and low level service they dont understand your concern,0
AirIndia,9.0,it was worth the value,S Harush,2021-03-14,i had decided to use my miles to redeem the flight from mangalore after having a good vacation and was able to successfully book the flight and select my seat without any issues the check in and baggage drop was quick and easy the load on this flight was on the lighter side and so as a result the flight was by and large very uneventful boarding also started well ahead of time and as far as the inflight service was concerned only a drink was provided the arrival and baggage collection was also done swiftly for a journey which was redeemed using miles it was worth the value and the process was very smooth,1
AirIndia,1.0,charged rs 20000 for luggage weight,Sushant Rana,2021-03-14,the ticketing staff at delhi terminal 3 is worst i had to stand for 2 hours just to drop bags even after echecking and when my turn came i was thrown here and there and charged rs 20000 for luggage weight i don’t mind giving the amount if it’s the rule and is legit the desk person let go a girl without even weighing her carry on telling her why do you want to weigh it if you can lift it that means it’s not that’s heavy and the same guy charged me around rs 600 per kg i don’t mind doing that but what i saw him doing with that girl is totally unprofessional save yourself from a rude experience by not traveling by air india,0
AirIndia,1.0,flight has been rescheduled three times,Sathiavathy Karappan,2021-03-14,my original travel date was on 16th january and flight has been rescheduled three times worst thing is that their call centre staff are so rude so never again,0
AirIndia,1.0,not following protocols or any rules,Annmary Jacob,2021-03-14,the staff are not at all polite they are so rude and are doing things in their on will not following protocols or any rules i was flying from cochin to delhi then to toronto in a air india connection flight the air india staff from delhi did not let me fly even when i had a valid pcr report with me they were so rude and they stopped me from boarding telling that they need to verify my result the supervisor at the delhi airport was being so irresponsible and later was not clearly saying anything about why im not eligible to travel then he later apologized and told me he will book one ticket for me the next day  i stayed there from 1 am in the morning to 11 am talking to everyone in air india asking about this issue no one responded in a good way and even was laughing at me the supervisors are even worse with no responsibility they even took back my boarding pass from delhi to toronto to take away the proof worst ever flight experience and i lost 1 lakh 10000 rupees for a new ticket they didnt even refund me or didnt do anything even when they did the wrong thing to me,0
AirIndia,7.0,the inflight experience was quite nice,V Reddy,2021-03-14,on this flight from kolkata to bangalore when i tried to do the web check in i came to know that the flight got rescheduled by 2 hours which was unexpected and not exactly welcome as we were hoping to save some time also when doing the web check in i was also surprised to see that the system was unable to recognize the pnr which was quite strange however the mobile check in was successful and even though the timing of the flight was uncertain just 1 day before the departure the airline provided a confirmation of the flight timings via sms the baggage drop and ground process was quick and smooth boarding was on schedule and the departure was also slightly delayed by 15 mins due to the air show in bangalore however the crew made up for the time enroute the airline has also resumed full meal service and lunch was provided which was a welcome addition the meal was good and nice and we landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule which was good the web check in experience could have been better and also the rescheduling was not exactly welcome but the inflight experience was quite nice and the crew was very good in looking after the passengers i would fly with air india again in the future for the right price and timing convenience but they need to try to minimize the rescheduling of flights,1
AirIndia,1.0,worst staff behaviour ever,Sangita dubey Dubey,2021-03-14,worst staff behaviour ever my flight was 1615 on jan 25th but it reschedule by 20 min earlier to 1555 on the same day i reached airport boarding pass counter at 1505 they checked i have done my web checking also immediately they said the luggage belt is close but boarding is going on but i can’t go with my luggage i have to throw it there i said i’ll carry my with me in hand luggage but still they not ready finally after five minutes they argued i decide to throw my 1 luggage in dustbin so at least i can go but still they said we don’t have time to to do all this very rude arrogant attitude they have,0
AirIndia,1.0,such a terrible experience,Gazal Banga,2021-03-14,i am having such a terrible experience with air india airline i forgot my baggage in the aircraft and there is absolutely no response from the airline have been waiting at the airport for an hour they bluntly reply that they dont have any staff to pick up the bag and they cant do anything about it i have never experienced such an unresponsive and cold attitude on behalf of airline staff i dont think i will choose air india flight again,0
AirIndia,1.0,such a terrible airline,Eliza Kento,2021-03-14,i booked the ticket for my parents from assam to bangalore via kolkata as there were no direct flight available on the particular date and i booked it only on the basis of the waiting period which was very less compared to the other flights however on the day the flight which was suppose to take off at 830 and reach bengaluru by max 3pm on the same day took off at 11 from assam which is understandable because it can get quite foggy during winter but after reaching kolkata there was no information or any message from the airline regarding the delayed flight to bengaluru my dad has a chronic kidney disease and its difficult to travel for long hour and moreover they are not frequent flyers not even a single staff from air india passed any kind of information and on enquiry they simply raised their eyebrow with that arrogant attitude i wonder what they are so proud of i just wish i had their names the airline completely forgot their customer such a terrible airline there is more to it so the flight was delayed from kolkata to bengaluru via hyderabad again by legit 11hr which was also unsure of finally they boarded the flight at 1050pm and reached bengaluru at 3pm overall these airline have the worst attitude towards their customer,0
AirIndia,2.0,completely disgusted with my experience2,S Harten,2021-03-14,average airline with terrible customer service and unacceptable corporate behavior completely disgusted with my experience after a year of chasing air india for a refund due to a flight that they cancelled i have yet to receive a single cent i did not even find out about the cancellation until after i arrived to the airport and was informed at the check in counter apparently they tried to call me once and i didnt pick up no email notification nor textnothing several emails went by without a response for months i waited repeatedly calling customer service until i received an email saying they would only issue a refund when things returned to normalcy now it has been 12 months half of the time you call their number you will get a message saying its the wrong number the other half of the time it wont go through at all when you finally reach them you receive service from staff so incompetent its obvious they were not even given basic training of how to look up information in their system you feel sorry for them as they fumble around i wont even blame the call center staff as its obvious the responsibility lies on the complete negligence of the air india management to run an efficient operation why are airlines allowed to get away with this behavior any other business would have been shut down a long time ago this is not a review of the flight experience itself which is generally average but if you can fly with a better airline absolutely do it,0
AirIndia,3.0,bad experience as always,S Garheen,2021-03-14,every time there a bad experience with air india this time i’m flyng amritsar from delhi i’m currently in flight right now and writing this review before this there was a huge line for boarding where before entering the craft they were taking the luggage as there no space for luggage in the craft while asking the reason for that they were silent as per my knowledge one baggage is allowed per person so how come all the space is full no explanation at all when the lady sent me further where the guy is putting a luggage tag got offended when i asked him why is this happening rude staff bad experience as always,0

IndiGo,2.0,uncomfortable seats and subpar food,Himani Goyal,2024-09-23,i recently had the misfortune of experiencing one of the worst international flights ever the uncomfortable seats and subpar food were shocking especially for a longhaul flight the meal service was particularly disappointing with poha being served on a 56 hour flight moreover there were no quilts for babies whats more concerning is the airlines decision to fly smaller planes on international routes,0
IndiGo,3.0,we have to wait for 12 hrs outside,Barnali Shankar,2024-09-23,the ticket was from bali to mumbai with a 12 hrs layover at bangalore airport the terminals were supposed to be changed as we deboarded at bangalore t2 airport the airline gave us no clue that we have to wait for 12 hrs outside t1 airport which was ridiculous we asked them to help us out to at least make us wait in the lobby area of the airport that also they were not ready to accept and said you have booked tickets you shall know the ground staff at bangalore was rude,0
IndiGo,1.0,making everyone unpack their bags,Randall Hamilton,2024-09-23,worst for confusion about how to scan bags took forever to set up then they were making everyone unpack their bags because they don’t know what they’re looking at i had a reading light for reading a book and it confused them people were taking things out then when indigo saw the items they were like that’s ok they have no idea what they’re looking at in the scan,0
IndiGo,2.0,ways to grab money from your customers,N Harkiya,2024-09-23,i had an excess of 3 kgs of luggage which the executive rudely ignored i had no had carry’s and he said that both can’t be clubbed then while boarding they say that give your hand carry’s as there is no enough place in the aircraft  are these ways to grab money from your customers they call themselves an amazing air line such misconceptions they have about themselves,0
IndiGo,2.0,not at all customer friendly,S Nagabhirava,2024-09-23,the flight was scheduled to leave at 905 am it was delayed to 10am then again it was delayed to 1020am and again to 1030am and again to 1045am in the meantime there was a 10am flight that left on time when i asked to bump to the 10am flight at the time of checkin they would not do it although there were plenty of seats worst communication by ground staff with no proper explanation for the delay not at all customer friendly i had to sit at the airport for 3hrs for a 1hr flight pathetic airline and incompetent staff,0
IndiGo,1.0,more than 45 mins for baggage to come,M Habur,2024-09-23,flight delayed no exact time announced left almost half an hour late the baggage was delayed more than the flight it took more than 45 mins for baggage to come they just announced operation issues in bangalore airport it is the first time i have seen such horrible delay even if we walked with luggage one by one we could carry all luggage in less than 45 mins by a handful people they have taken customers for granted and need to end their monopoly,0
IndiGo,1.0,both flights were delayed by 2 hours,Steve Dsouza,2024-09-23,my family  i took a return flight from dammam to bombay both flights were delayed by 2 hours we were not informed before we reached the airport on both occasions we had specifically booked flights to get a good nights rests  both flights we were unable to do the same we reached dammam airport at 9 00 pm  after standing in queue for 45 mins were informed about a delay  check in did not begin till 11 pm the worst part is that we faced the same issue on our return flight the crew was unapologetic about the delay  instead of offering in flight services at 11 30 pm as per the original schedule passengers were rudely woken up for inflight services at 1 30 am waiting at the airport from 6 30 pm for a 10 30 am flight is alright but our flight was delayed so much that we only taxied out of bombay at 1230 am  everyone was exhausted it seems to be that these delays were planned  timed to leave 2 hours later on purpose by the airlines to save time or money or both without any consideration for the inconvenience caused to 100s of tired passengers families  children,0
IndiGo,10.0,value for money,H Darsayn,2024-09-23,this is an airline with some of the friendliest staff the planes was well maintained and though this is a budget airline the seats are comfy with enough leg space food options to buy are limited but this airline is value for money,1
IndiGo,5.0,unacceptable and very poor service,S Comar,2024-09-23,india is very poor in customer service there is barely any concept of good professional customer service they don’t care about customer loyalty this is even more evident with airlines as there is very little competition in the domestic sector that is now basically a duopoly between indigo and air india i have had heaps of bad experiences with air india and had to forego many flights when they change schedule when they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money i preferred indigo as i found the service good and had no problems until recently i had booked return flights ixcjdh in early july to fly in late august a week ago on checking my bookings on their app i found they had changed my inbound flight from jdh to ixc from a layover in jai to del no issue with that however there was no message or email from the airline of the change i just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app not only that the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours had i not checked i would have missed my flight as the new time was not suitable to me i called the airline i was able to change to a later time however i was told i must pay a change fee of inr 2000 per ticket you change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it i explained to the agent that this is an involuntary change and i must not have to pay for it the agent put me on hold to get an authorisation i was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge in such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation they should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end now after a week i find out they have once again made a schedule change they have now moved my flight from jdh to 1450 from 1025 i will arrive in del at 1625 however they have not amended my connecting flight delixc that is scheduled at 1505 which will land in ixc before i even arrive in del so i am back on the phone to indigo i requested them to put me on their delixc flt at 1725 once again they are unable to do that was advised they will check and call me back got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight they want me to take a 5 hour layover in delhi and arrive in ixc at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours i once again pleaded my case was told they will check call me again again refused obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport no empathy at all there is no recourse either take it or leave it i find this totally unacceptable and very poor service,0
IndiGo,2.0,struggled due to online payment,Manin Kulkarni,2024-08-10,indigo treated my son in humanly at hyderabad airport who was travelling first time alone as a student following things happened at airport of hyderabad  check in staff charged excess luggage fee which my son was willing to pay but he struggled due to online payment the staff removed him from the queue twice and every time made him come in queue  they happily allowed him to throw his study books in dustbin no courtesy was shown or effort made to talk to parents we were online but airline staff did not task to us or help us they made him go to empty desk and wait and then a staff came she told your flight luggage time is closed you can throw luggage here and board alone the delay was done by staff by making him queue twice and then denied boarding he wasnt guided properly to rebook the flight my son was struggling with bags and there was no human touch to support him he managed to rebook the flight just to know that all previous ticket features like extra luggage and food were stripped down they finally took him in next flight with extra luggage cost i dont have issue paying thrice the price to airline but really disappointed how they treated a student flying first time allowed him to throw books no guidance this was small amount which as parents we could have paid to staff or someone to help student god knows what they will do with elderly,0
IndiGo,1.0,quite disappointing,Pooja Deshpande,2024-08-10,my experience from bangkok to bangalore was quite disappointing they no longer provide fragile stickers which is concerning for passengers with fragile items in their luggage additionally considering its an international flight the basic fare does not include any complimentary meals or drinks even water is not provided unless specifically requested the inflight services are also overpriced with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees furthermore there are no pillows or blankets provided making the presence of five or six cabin crew members seem unnecessary if they are not providing any services if you are traveling to thailand suggest you take thai airways much better services comfortable and better price too,0
IndiGo,1.0,ground service of indigo is the worst,N Hasani,2024-08-10,the ground service of indigo is the worst the 2 ladies of cochin ground service was beyond rude and disrespectful and charged me 1000 extra for a luggage that was below the allowed amount under student discount their claim was that it was in 2 baggages instead of a single one i am a frequent flyer and this has never occurred in any of the airports before including cochin for the same type of services so i am guessing this was specifically because of these 2 ladies who were themselves confused on how much to charge me and wasted 20 minutes horrible,0
IndiGo,2.0,very rude people working for it,T Maykell,2024-08-10,this is the last time i will ever choose indigo very rude people working for it the person who issued ticket was the least i look forward to very cunning,0

IndiGo,1.0,its a very bad service,Manoj Jena,2024-08-10,this flight i missed due to airline ignorance or bad service first they declared gate 8 then they declared gate no 4 i was sitting in front of the gate no 4 and till 835pm the screen was showing it was delayed and suddenly at 845pm screen was showing flight departed my check in was done security check was done but i didnt get right information of flight status either on the display screen or anything from the flight hostess no one called after they were very rude in behavior its a very bad service i requested them for arrange in another flight for that they charged rs2500 again i have requested for the refund but they deny,0
IndiGo,5.0,a bad experience,Gaspard Grass,2024-08-10,my indigo flight 6e11 delist on 17 june 2024 was a bad experience first the codeshare with turkish does not work properly it is impossible to make the web checkin online and to choose seats we have to wait until we arrive at the airport the schedule of this flight is very unconfortable making us impossible to have a hotel breakfast before boarding we had 1 hour delay and not a single cabin announcement to explain it the captain was unable to make any announcement except a brief incomprehensible announcement just before landing the onboard entertainment was not working and we had to make the whole journey with a white screen without any idea of the time and our position the stewardesses distributed water generously but instead of a meal i received only a tiny portion of vegetable curry i was so hungry that i had to rush into a turkish restaurant at the istanbul airport the stewardesses are nice but they still wear the ridiculous girl power badge being a supporter of gender equality i am shocked by this provocation and i would find it nice to also have men in the crew,0
IndiGo,1.0,was charged 10000 rs extra,Namrata Dubey,2024-08-10,my sister had flight today at 125 from lucknow to ahmedabad on 8th june 2024 she reached airport at 1225 pm and there was a long que in front of checkin counter she printed boarding pass 1 day ago and in that was they mentioned boarding time 1240 pm she reached at counter by 1225 pm 1 hours before flight though she reached at time they didnt allow her to go into the flight and asked her to pay 5000 rs extra to go to next flight in evening she paid money through upi but they didnt accept that receipt and she had to again pay 5000 rs by debit card without breaking any rule she was charged 10000 rs extra 5000 rs through upi 5000 rs through debit card and also couldnt go to flight and they rescheduled it they also charge 200 rs for taking boarding pass though other flights doesn’t charge any extra money for boarding pass on counter,0
IndiGo,1.0,charged me extra for my hand luggage,L Gomil,2024-08-10,worst experience they are the worst staff with worst attitude they didnt let me take my hand luggage so they asked it to be weighed and when it was obviously extra for the hand over luggage they charged me extra for my hand luggage weight they warned me that if i dont pay up ill miss my flight and have to book another i had to pay extra when i arrived at my destination i didnt get my luggage they asked me to come back to airport to receive my luggage in the evening but i got a call stating theyll send next day what is wrong with indigo seriously,0
IndiGo,2.0,staff is inconsiderate and inhuman,T Sanderson,2024-08-10,indigo airlines are unreasonably inflexible they value nonsense rules over humanity it seems we were flying to lucknow to visit ayodhya the reason we booked this flight was that it was a direct 2 hour flight and my parents are old and i did not want to get a longer itinerary with multiple flights the flight was at 645am we reached airport at 530am i just stood in the long queue as it was the only counter that was working there later i found that it was for bag drop only when asking about checkin counter they asked to check in at kiosk when i reached there it said checkin window is closed and that was actually very tight i ran to the only counter for all time assistance and it was queue there also they asked me to go to supervisor vismaya inspite of sharing my concern with her that our trip is a very short one and we need to reach there soon she just did a formal call to manager who said it is not possible to check in now my parents flight was already checked in and mine which was separate had some issues checking in one day prior when i tried they said that your parents can board but not myself i made humble request to consider our situation she kept on saying we understand but we cannot help it she booked another flight and charged extra 2500 inr per person even when the new flight was having several vacant seats the new itinerary was long and had multiple flights the second flight was delayed by an hour and they changed gates at the end moment and we were all tired standing up where there was no formal seating arrangement the staff there also kept on reprimanding people to be standing in like be where there was no queue absolutely he was just standing there and targeting people unnecessarily there were heated arguments there also with other passengers and the staff the airline is absolutely horrible staff is inconsiderate and inhuman as i found they were behaving as if they are obliging us by having us onboarded at the flight i will never want to travel with this flight again,0

IndiGo,6.0,we ended up missing the flight,Suhas Madan,2024-05-24,i booked from chandigarh to bagdogra with 1 hour layover at delhi the flight from chd had a delayed start  and the flight landed at 1256 pm instead of 1220  my connecting flight to bagdogra was at 120 and i had my father who is a senior citizen we approached the first indigo desk about we were made to move from one counter to another post landing and i kept telling the staff that we do not have time and they should communicate at the flight gate that we are on our way in the end we ended up missing the flight and we would have not missed it had the staff been more vigilant and more communication savy as luck would have it i met mr gurprakash at the door of my closed out flight and i gave him my piece of mind he took all my words with good patience and booked me into the next flight had all the staff members been more vigilant or cooperative i would have been on my original flight,1

IndiGo,7.0,pleasant cabin crew,T Reddy,2024-05-24,the flight is a standard indigo experience pleasant cabin crew and since it was just 45 minutes i did not prebook or purchase a meal onboard however this flight was delayed by almost 45 minutes and then to add to the delay the aircraft was parked in a remote stand i had a connecting flight with another airline in bangalore and almost missed it,1
IndiGo,8.0,a comfortable enough flight,S Hartin,2024-05-24,indigo initially changed the flight from 230 pm to a morning departure but the call centre was quite helpful since i could not leave in the morning from mumbai they accommodated me on a later flight at 3 pm in the afternoon the checkin queue was long but very efficient and i was able to checkin my bag in no time i had prebooked a meal combo on the flight the signature chicken junglee sandwich which was very good and a juice however the beverage quantity served was very little just about 100 ml the seat was comfortable with ample leg room a regular economy seat the crew was friendly and prompt overall a comfortable enough flight,1
IndiGo,8.0,overall quite happy,S Haltin,2024-05-24,efficient and comfortable flight quick checkin courteous and attentive cabin crew the prebooked in flight meal was good and the regular economy class seat was quite comfortable for this short flight with enough legroom overall quite happy,1
IndiGo,10.0,his fantastic hospitality,M Aishwarya,2024-05-24,we would like to share our positive experience while traveling in indigo 6e1005 on 04th april 2024 from bangalore to singapore the service received from mr karthik at the bangalore terminal 2 checkin staff at the counter was exemplary i was traveling alone with an infant it would have been very difficult for me to handle the checkin procedure along with my 1yearold baby but he was excellent and courteous the service provided by him was of a very high standard and should be an example for other crew members in any airline we would like to thank him for his fantastic hospitality and look forward to similar services and experiences we would appreciate it if you could pass on our sincere thanks to the above member of your crew,1
IndiGo,1.0,i was three minutes late,Yogendra Shrestha,2024-05-24,i was denied entry to the gate because i was three minutes late the lack of flexibility in this regard was not only disappointing but also inconvenient especially considering that i had made efforts to arrive punctually the flight was 40 minutes delayed later but still they forced us to pay for another adding to the frustration was the absence of announcements regarding boarding procedures  to make matters worse when i opted to pay for a subsequent flight i observed a stark contrast in the boarding procedure  i witnessed passengers being allowed to board just five minutes before departure  while i acknowledge that punctuality is essential in the airline industry there should be a balance between adherence to schedules and customer service,0
IndiGo,3.0,absolutely rips people off,Dhriti Ranjan,2024-05-24,indigo is absolutely rubbish they had a service fast forward for which they charge extra money around 600700inr this service used to ensure that the passengers purchasing fast forward will get their bag first after deboarding the plane so i used to get fast forward because it was convenient having travelled today at the check in counter the staff tells me that there is no baggage advantage and i will get priority boarding something their fast forward service used to marketed for and now it serves no purpose indigo absolutely rips people off for extra money and doesnt provide any service that they promise to offer,0
IndiGo,2.0,irresponsible behaviour,Suneet Mishra,2024-05-24,it was so surprising and disappointing to see delay of flight 40 mins as one of cabin crew came late and all passengers were waiting inside the aircraft so irresponsible behaviour by indigo,0

IndiGo,1.0,their cheap fare is not worth it,G Pea,2024-03-05,i thought ive seen the worst but this is even worse the worst airline experience ive ever had no food or on board entertainment whwatsoever during the long fllights to and from my transit in new delhi from singapore with istanbul as final destination im fine with that but the on ground experience has been terrible at the gate i was told to go to desk for document check and asked to show visa to my final destination which is after istanbul and has nothing to do with my flight with indigo and worst of all i lost my checked in luggage once i arrived in istanbul that has never happened in all my 25 years of frequent travel all of those reviews youve seen about lost luggage  bad customer service with indigo are completely true their cheap fare is not worth it i regretted not checking indigos reviews before taking this airline for the first time on this flight looking back i would rather just pay more than taking the bait of cheap fare from indigo avoid it,0
IndiGo,1.0,pushed me to take a refund,S Halshya,2024-03-05,they cancelled my ticket one week in advance on an international trip and when i pushed them to book me on another flight they booked me on another flight but denied boarding to me at the airport and then pushed me to take a refund which i have still not received after 1 week i had to book a long distance flight for 2 people from the airport which costed a lot more than my original ticket,0
IndiGo,2.0,crew very nervous and chaotic,Ira Nagel,2024-03-05,i used to love flying indigo for domestic flights in india but this long haul codeshare flight with tk was really disappointing it is a too big difference with turkish airlines only a one time service on a flight duration of 75 hours on the leg delhiistanbul which is already extremely long the second drink was only served to half of the people and then the crew disappeared i was only able to get a coffee by a crew call the third round was chargeable what a poor service crew very nervous and chaotic very very indian english hardly understandable tiny seats not even space for arms and shoulders no inflight entertainment no indigo never again on a longhaul flight there are better options,0
IndiGo,2.0,particular flight was terrible,S Garven,2024-03-05,ive travelled indigo airlines before and had a pleasant experience with them however this one particular flight was terrible we were flying out of mumbai to phuket we entered the aircraft on the tarmac and we entered a mosquito infested cabin mumbai airport seems to have a mosquito problem and this is a health and safety issue during my flight i was bitten nearly a dozen times the officials at indigo airlines and mumbai airport really need to tackle this mosquito problem that exists at the airport thank you,1
IndiGo,2.0,one of worst flight operators,Shashi Singh,2024-03-05,one of worst flight operators they delay flight just 13 hours before schedule depature once the fight is near delayed departure time they will delay it further they are highly unprofessional and money minded and dont care for any customer people also dont have options as they are the biggest domestic operators they shamelessly make money from every thing in flight you pay for boarding seats meals i’m surprised why they have not started charging for using the lavatories,0
IndiGo,3.0,website and mobile app is bad,E Zografakis,2024-03-05,i had the worst customer experience trying to book the ticket their website and mobile app is bad their payment system is even worst i am not sure if i face issues as a foreigner and if the system works well for the locals but i have spent several hours trying to book a ticket and when i finally made it and i saw the money were taking from my account i thought that all went well out of luck i noticed some days later that the booking was not finalised and the money were returned to my account they never contacted me via email about this the actual ground service is actually good and their personnel on air is also good but their website and digital experience is the worst you can get,0
IndiGo,8.0,a good experience,B Latlae,2024-03-05,traveling from tiruchirapalli to guwahati was a good experience it all started with which the services of ground staff sakthipriya t indigo whose politeness and overall demeanour is highly appreciable,1

IndiGo,1.0,they do not care,Achim Nuhr,2024-03-05,for the first time ever after around 50 years of flying my baggage got lost after insisting some staff were worried enough to deal with me as a european on a domestic flight after 3 hours and 6 different employees i finally got a ridiculous pink copy of a handwritten report  like 50 years ago in my hotel i wasted 2 hours trying to chat with them to find out if my loss has been registered  and jumped from position 550 to 26 then back to 3xx back and forth meaningless after calling them a robots voice sounded like a scifimovie from the 50s useless again so far indigo acts inhuman without any empathy for my loss they do not care who is interested in seat comfort when the baggage gets lost and nobody at indigo cares,0
IndiGo,1.0,indigo customer review,Tangirala Reddy,2024-01-17,i was not even given water after repeated requests and was finally told that i have to pay i paid for international travel that includes food the crew told me that they don’t have a contract with qatar which is not true the crew need better training another time i was traveling from ahmadabad to hyderabad sitting in the front row of the flight by the time i arrived i was bitten by several mosquitos the dgca need to take stringent action i have promised myself not to fly indigo again,0

IndiGo,1.0,left me with a sense of dissatisfaction,N Nishanth,2023-11-30,i recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with missing luggage during my travels with indigo upon arrival at my destination i discovered that my luggage was nowhere to be found the process of reporting the missing items was timeconsuming and lacked clear communication the staff seemed overwhelmed and there was a noticeable lack of urgency in resolving the issue while i understand that mishaps can occur the delay in locating and delivering my luggage was frustrating i felt a disconnect between the airline and its passengers during this ordeal and the updates provided were minimal leaving me in the dark about the status of my belongings in the end my luggage was eventually recovered and returned to me but the overall experience left me with a sense of dissatisfaction,0
IndiGo,2.0,flight is delayed for 2 hrs,Prasad Reddy,2023-11-30,one of worst hospitality on 19112023 flight is delayed for 2 hrs no announcement or any information on delay staff at terminal gates does not have any idea on delay and are not ready to provide any proper information they are just chilling out and avoiding customers they are not ready to provide their superior number or call him to the gate they are simply saying you can send an email on delay or else can go to the main counter for further information,0
IndiGo,8.0,par with the international carriers,Suneet Rajshekhar,2023-11-30,if not for the efficient soniya at ground staff i would have not made it also the onboard team make this budget airline at par with the international carriers i think there is a reason why people relate with indigo as a national carrier,1

IndiGo,6.0,overall a nofuss experience,S Shetty,2023-11-30,the flight was just about alright for the 2 hour hop between delhi and mumbai indigo has introduced automated baggage drop but the instructions etc are not very clear so most end up needing assistance delhis terminal 1 is undergoing significant modification and hence the onground experience is not very good with chaotic security lines and limited food options and charging stations the inflight experience was courteous but clinical a typical lcc experience the legroom was adequate and being an airbus the seat width is better but the slim seats are not very supportive and i would hate to be in them for anything longer than a 2 hour journey the crew do offer free water on the flight on request and in a small glass but only after the prebooked meals are handed over which on a hot day can be awful remember to carry a water bottle since in flight water bottle cost the absence of chargers app based ife will be felt on longer journeys overall a nofuss experience but worth it only if you are saving at least 10001500 over full fare carriers like vistaraair india on the bomdel leg other wise the cost of food at the airport or onground will mean the net savings are nil for frequent fliers with status on other carriers the bar is even higher,0
IndiGo,2.0,very bad experience,S Ganhela,2023-11-30,i travelled from istanbul to delhi by indigo airlines 6e12 on 23102023 along with my wife  the flight was horrible with very little leg space the air hostesses did not care for the passengers and they did not care to offer water also i would strongly advise people not to choose indigo very bad experience to me and to my wife,0

IndiGo,1.0,incredibly disappointed by the appalling service,Jerome Jacob Xavier,2023-08-18,im incredibly disappointed by the appalling service provided by indigo airlines during my recent transit experience at chennai airport the mishandling of 5 guests who were flying to colombo due to the trichy flight delay by 1 hour is a clear testament to the utter lack of competence and professionalism displayed by the airline  not only was there a complete lack of communication about the delay and the subsequent impact on connecting flights but the airline failed to provide any assistance or support  its clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this airline,0
IndiGo,1.0,manually tagged bags were missing,S Birvali,2023-08-18,traveling with indigo on our recent family trip from hyd to dfw via doh proved to be a frustrating experience that left us feeling helpless and disappointed during our checkin at hyd indigos system was down leading to 7 out of our 13 total checkedin bags being manually tagged though we understood that technical issues can happen what followed was a series of missteps upon arrival at dfw we discovered that all 7 manually tagged bags were missing the qatar airways team at dfw had no information about these manually generated tags leaving us stranded without vital belongings we called indigos customer care 9 times over three days and each time the response was the same unable to reach the hyderabad crew and no managers on the call center floor to escalate our issue the lack of responsiveness and the inability to locate our bags with crucial manual tags felt like a major oversight what added to our frustration was that 5 of the 7 manual tags were taken back by the indigo team when their system came back online leaving us without any physical proof polite customer care representatives though unable to assist failure in handling manual tag situation during system downtime while we appreciate that technical issues can occur its the handling of such problems that defines a companys reputation,0

IndiGo,1.0,had the most frustrating experience,D Rao,2023-07-08,i had the most frustrating experience with indigo recently i was flying from vadodara to mumbai and later in the evening connecting on an international flight to the us while i was aware that i was allowed only one bag when i checked in with two bags the counter staff calculated additional charges for rs 12000 please note that this is more than the charge for a roundtrip ticket between vadodara and mumbai i urged the staff including the manager on duty to reconsider as this made no sense i even offered to buy them a roundtrip ticket just to drop my extra bag off in mumbai and return to vadodara while the ground staff was very courteous i believe the airlines pricing strategy is blatantly skewed towards fleecing international travelers on one hand indigo makes history by placing the single largest order of aircrafts at the paris air show which as a person of indian origin i am proud of and literally a week later i get to experience first hand how they plan to make money by fleecing the indian diaspora on extra baggage fees,0

IndiGo,8.0,comparatively better than others,HP Naz,2023-07-08,indigo is comparatively better than any other airline ive ever travelled in india usually in indian aircraft that travel to and from the middle east the flight attendants service is quite bad here though indigo is a budget airline the service is similar to that of a premium airline the only thing they can improve is that usually in middle eastern flights which travel to kerala they give announcements in arabic english and malayalam but in indigo and other indian aircrafts they give the announcement in english and hindi i feel that in an aircraft flying to kerala announcements in hindi are useless since none of us malayalee know proper hindi we can just understand it from here and there,1

IndiGo,10.0,i had an outstanding experience with this airline,R Shaw,2022-12-11,i had an outstanding experience with this airline flying three routes from blr to hyd then hyd to lko and then lko to bom all three flights left right on time and arrived early to their destination check in was easy at airport and used their app for boarding passes and check in on board the crews were polite and worked swiftly to serve passengers i am unsure why all of the negative reviews this airlines is leagues above any us carrier,1
IndiGo,1.0,management should be truly be ashamed,M Keele,2022-12-11,so i tried to heed the many warnings that i saw in this airlines terrible reviews regarding their baggage scam policy i recently had a flight from mumbai to maldives for which the ticket fare was 159 for a oneway ticket still a little pricey but not bad the only reason why i took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the maldives after booking the ticket i noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance my initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight but im sure i can purchase a bag just in case the week of the flight i spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options one problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling at 48 hours i started the attempt to add a bag the website is not userfriendly when it comes to adding bags when you click on the add bags button it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now neither of these buttons work i tried on safari chrome and also my mobile nada the day before the flight i spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it on my mobile i was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight but only 5 kilos you click on that button and the screen goes blank long story short i had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag i finally found the loophole when you go to 6e addons where the add baggage should be but isnt and just click on anything that is listed it will take you to the addon page and then there it is add a bag more confusion sets in because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees 22 usd i thought perfect one catch i didnt see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on all the other airline websites out there the morning of the flight i saw my bags were still a little too heavy so i added an extra 5 kilos which was 40 for just 5 kilos yes 40 for just 5 kilos i get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos guy said that my bags were too heavy i was so confused i tried what i could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway come to find out you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos total doesnt say total on the website so you have to pay 22 extra for the same exact weight but for an additional bag what the ever living that makes no sense you pay extra for a bag but actually get less weight because the additional bag will also add weight so you have to pack less items what a disaster i ended up having to pay 162 in baggage fees for my 159 flight how the government allows this i have no clue i saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery good description but more like extortion i also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling you have been warned do not use this airline hopefully one day a reputable airline like vistara which was great will buy this company out and change things around for the good because the current management should be truly be ashamed and if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight it was a normal size plane probably more to the larger size there is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is greed beware,0
IndiGo,3.0,scattered from seat no 15 to 31,B Jalan,2022-10-30,all the paid window and aisle seats are reserved for those who will pay for it me and family got scattered from seat no 15 to 31 during boarding they made us a call to run fast towards gates even when we checked in an hour before the departure time,0

IndiGo,1.0,careless with sensitive luggage,S Wayamandi,2022-09-19,indigo was utterly careless in handing a sensitive item like infant  baby child restraint system crs and caused damage even after we safely handed it to them at the gate  the bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination the bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly we use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues  it is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k inr due to indigos shoddy handling we made indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at vtz without trying to understand the extent of the damage indigos agent blindly offered 500 rupees we did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount she also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel it is appalling that indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business we left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a property irregularity report pir with her and use the pir to later submit a claim to indigo later we later found out that leaving the airport without pir means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold indigo liable anymore indigo was careless with sensitive luggage items like a car seat and did not offer a fair resolution even after they were made aware,0

IndiGo,8.0,the crew were able to discharge their duties well,V Reddy,2022-07-16,i had to book this flight very suddenly due to an urgent issue and also due to the ongoing atf prices for the airlines the prices were on the higher side the online check in was a smooth process and as this was booked with a corporate fare the seat selection was free the baggage drop at the counter was a smooth and quick affair boarding started on time and the crew were able to discharge their duties well for the corporate meal i was pleased to note that the selection had increased from the last time and also included items like chicken noodles and biriyani along with tea coffee juices the portions of the food were okay the flight landed on time and the crew did not manage to wish goodbye and thank others but did wish me when i passed by which was appreciated one thing to note was that the inflight magazine and the air sickness bag were not there on every seat and perhaps this is something that can be included on all seats as a feedback item but otherwise this was a good flight,1

IndiGo,8.0,recent experience was a fantabulous one,Arjun Kumar,2022-05-15,while indigo does boast about its on time departure and pre time arrival i dont think that is what makes it the best airline i have never liked the attitude of many air hostesses on this airline as i have always found them on the edge of being rude however my recent experience was a fantabulous one and i need to appreciate two women who made this journey a happy one joyce  based at the indigo counters in hyderabad automatically upgraded my seat from 4c to 1c seeing that i am a tall man and would have issues in the back seats janett  air hostess on the flight 6e  796 departure time 1950 dated 30322 she was extremely hospitable and showed all signs of a great hospitality professional she was kind understanding and spoke to all passengers in a polite manner,1
IndiGo,1.0,last time i will fly with indigo,R Kabasri,2022-05-15,this is for the last time i will fly with indigo i had to ask for water forget anything else forget choosing free seats the lights were very dim making reading impossible last time in november 2021 i flew with indigo from mumbai to kolkata i booked about 20 days or so in advance thrice my flight was rescheduled and i had to change my entire programme i paid extra for a window seat,0
IndiGo,1.0,all seats shown as occupied,Sanjeev Kumar,2022-05-15,i was travelling with my infant and wife so tried to do web checkin so that we can get seats together however all seats shown as occupied so i reached the airport 25 hr prior to get seats together i waited 15 min in queue then requested same to counter she sent me to a different counter then again waited for 15min in a queue then finally she said we couldnt do it so we were given 28a which having a baby seat also you keep your baby in the baby seat and request co passenger for interchange we couldnt find baby seat there same thing asked to airhostess she replied there is no baby seat they didnt even gave the baby belt which is mandatory airline not for babies,0
IndiGo,4.0,dont expect any support,Stephanie Preyer,2022-02-27,i originally intended to give indigo a good revues as ive been travelling india for 2 months and their service was fine for the most part however in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and i felt compelled to warn other travellers firstly they didnt inform travellers that nepal requires an exit pcr test in order to leave the country of course you could argue that its up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country ive travelled throughout covid and nepal was the first country i went to requiring an exit test any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know but not indigo as a result there was chaos at the airport and i missed my flight along with 10 others i flew the next day kathmandu to chennai after paying 10000 rupees fare difference with a short layover in delhi i was assured by indigo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to chennai and they put chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in delhi upon arrival in chennai at 1am after a delayed departure i was told my bag hadnt arrived because i was supposed to have cleared customs at delhi airport its now been 3 days my bag is still in delhi and indigo have no idea whats going on they dont even know the right number to call at delhi airport to get an update at the end of the day fly indigo if you want a cheap flight and can count on things going according to plan but dont expect any support if there are any disruptions as they dont appear to have the customers best interests at heart,0
IndiGo,4.0,this is unorganised,A Harper,2022-02-27,only 15 kilograms check in luggage charge extra for everything demanding 200 rupees for not checking online although the link didnt work demanded extra for an extra couple of kilos not assigning empty seats for customers rather than cramping them together and leave empty seats at the back empty just because they didnt pay for these seats this is unorganised no food on the plane air india was exactly the opposite of this nice seat 25 kilos of luggage which is more than enough ultra smooth checkin and offered a sandwich and a drink on just 1 hour flight,0
IndiGo,9.0,overall an uneventful flight,A Vashun,2022-02-27,i took the flight to kolkata on indigo the web check in was done smoothly and it must be noted that the seats at the rear are cheaper as compared to those in the front which is strange as they are the same seats  the baggage drop was done quickly and efficiently at blr airport and boarding started well on time the crew were welcoming during boarding which was good and the arrival and baggage collection was also swift overall an uneventful flight which took me from point a to b without too much fuss,1
IndiGo,1.0,really cheap strategy,Vipin Babu,2022-02-27,i booked a ticket on indigo on 03 jan 22 for 05 jan 22 cochin to dubai at departure time 0030 local time but after the booking i get an sms stating the departure time on 05 jan 22 is 1300 local time which is a delay of almost 13 hours and do not serve my purpose for the day their website had a problem then why should i suffer for it hence i requested a full refund for which they are not willing to give i called them and after talking to their customer service for 01 hour or more she would not give a full refund neither solve the issue nor let me speak to her manager and wanted me to book for another date from her i understood that the 04 jan 22 flight was cancelled and they rescheduled the 05 jan 22 flight which i did not want due to the change in timing and fly with another airline as i have to reach on 05 jan 22 early morning these guys go by on time departure and arrival but none of that is true so all of you be beware and customer service has a few lines which they repeat for every question and it really annoys you as this is not the right reply in english for a question asked pathetic situation to cheat you out of your money as when you cancel they get a free amount of inr 5500 disgrace to this company and the people who work for it and own it really cheap strategy,0
IndiGo,5.0,its a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage,V Reddy,2022-02-27,on the return flight from indore the checkin of the luggage was done very swiftly as we reached the airport well ahead of departure the boarding also started well on time one thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage the crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during takeoff it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly being efficient and on time is important but never at the cost of safety the flight itself was uneventful with a upma  tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time i appreciate flying with the airline but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind and also its a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future the rating is given based on the safety violation of not stowing away the cabin bags under the seat during takeoff but apart from that the flight and crew were really good,1
IndiGo,9.0,could not have asked for anything better,S Vanush,2022-02-27,we had to go indore for a family function and on this particular flight we had checked in online and as the fare booked was a corporate fare the seat selection was free at bangalore airport there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access this is also something i experienced first hand and was very valuable the boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage i selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time the food was pretty decent along with the tea staff service was prompt and polite arrival was 30 mins ahead of schedule which was appreciated and the crew was wearing a smile on their faces even while deboarding and thanking the passengers overall could not have asked for anything better,1
IndiGo,2.0,we are very disappointed with the airline,Akhil Pavi,2022-02-27,to start with we were travelling to male maldives from cochin using indigo we had booked our flight from cochin to the maldives and then onwards to bahrain the check in counter staff member reacted very differently to us trying to travel telling us we are supposed to book a return flight back to india from the maldives as per ‘air bubble agreement’ since we didn’t have time to review the reasons mentioned by the airline we had no choice but to book a return flight to india this was not enough for the airline they wanted a direct flight back we again made our travel agent rebook while we didnt cancel our flight to bahrain since we didnt trust the totally misinformed indigo staff we travelled spent days in the maldives and travelled to bahrain without any hassles we checked and rechecked with male airport as well no such rule was there wrong information besides being totally un cooperative towards customers we are very disappointed with the airline especially as i have never experienced this we had asked to meet with the manager instead of asking him to come to talk to us we were sent to some counter where he was seated fidgeting with his phone laid back and totally uncooperative i am not a person who likes writing such reviews but such incidents are very very problematic hope indigo take appropriate action,0
IndiGo,2.0,flight had no meal supplies,Sumit Arora,2022-02-27,this flight had no meal supplies and i had a meal booked with my ticket  i was offered cashews  almonds in place of a meal at 8 pm the air hostess told me there are more options available but today we dont have any this happened when i was sitting in 6th row i can only imagine what people in 16th or 60th row had  why would you charge money for a meal  not provide it,0
IndiGo,10.0,keep up the good work,Rio Fernandes,2022-02-27,indigo staff chirag at the goa airport saved my day i was late to board the goa to mumbai indigo flight due to a road accident on 2nd october 2021 flight 6e 259  1950 the boarding gate was closed and i had a connecting flight to london the lady at the checkin desk was really helpful she first refused but later checked with chirag and than it was run run run  he guided me to the boarding gate made my london flight on time can’t thank him the the check in desk staff enough saved me from panic attack in the last 10 days i have travelled at least 5 times with the indigo excellent service from checking to departure and the best thing is it’s always on time keep up the good work,1
IndiGo,9.0,indigo must be proud both of you,Washim Akhter,2022-02-27,i was late for boarding to delhi from gorakhpur airport i reached at 1510 my flight was at 1540 the staff said i am late they were not allowing me to board but with the support of two employees of indigo airlines ruksar and satendra are really nice people they understand the situation the two have been very helpful to me she insisted on it and gave me my boarding pass thanks indigo must be proud both of you two,1
IndiGo,1.0,substandard quality of service,Irfan Ismail,2021-09-10,rude staff substandard quality of service and they will loot your money over excess baggage weight and other surprise fees not warned to the customer beforehand on their website their website for example provides the fee for pre booked additional baggage weight but does not mention the fee if excess baggage is found during boarding,0
IndiGo,10.0,the seat selection was free,V Sharun,2021-09-10,when doing the online web check in i was pleased to note that since i had booked using a corporate fare the seat selection was free and also i was entitled to 1 complementary snack onboard the flight the baggage drop process was smooth although due to huge queues at bangalore airport the indigo staff quickly collected all the bags from the pax in a separate queue which allowed quick deposit of the bags boarding started on time and i learnt that for the complementary snack there was a choice of upma  poha for veg items and chicken noodles for the non veg items along with the choice of a beverage hot  cold the sandwiches could not be availed as part of a cpml booking as i found out but the quantity of the items was on a generous side which was appreciated the flight landed also on time at kolkata however the baggage took some time before coming in the end i got more for what i paid for including free seat selection and a complementary meal and got safely to my destination on time cannot ask for anything more,1
IndiGo,10.0,one of the top lccs in asia,H Sharvun,2021-09-10,at mumbai airport during check in the staff took care to verify the negative rt pcr reports of all the passengers travelling to karnataka which was appreciated even though the seat selection during online check in was not free unlike the previous time when i flew which was a surprise boarding started well ahead of schedule and it seems that indigo is deploying with high capacity airbus a321 neo aircraft on high density routes to get as much passengers and load as possible the crew was welcoming and wished everyone during boarding and deboarding which was much appreciated as these small things do matter the luggage could have perhaps come a bit earlier than expected but apart from that there is nothing much that one can fault indigo on because everything was perfect the fare the on time arrival the crews attitude it has rightly achieved its status as one of the top lccs in asia,1
IndiGo,2.0,counters had been closed at 730,Aamli Agarwal,2021-09-10,i had a morning flight of 830 am from ahmedabad to lucknow i reached the airport at 725 am and was standing in the indigo line for checkin around 732 am the indigo lady asked where i was going and other few passengers as well when we informed her that it was lucknow the lady removed us from the line informing us that the counters had been closed at 730 she was very stubborn and was not ready to listen or even guide us on what to do next the next 20 min just flew by running from indigo counter to counter the lady on the reservation counter didnt even inform me of the fact that if a customer missed their flight and books it via their counter the fee charged is rps 1800 and the pnr given is the same a customer doesnt need to restart their booking again luckily my husband guided me on this procedure to which the lady confirmed,0
IndiGo,10.0,the seat selection was free,V Sharun,2021-09-10,i was pleased to note that during the online check in for this flight the seat selection was free because in previous experiences of flying with indigo they usually charge a fee of around rs 150 for selecting a seat the baggage drop was a smooth process and departure was on time the crew took steps to check for negative rtpcr reports or proof of fully vaccinated during the time of boarding which was appreciated arrival was on time and indigo did the job of transporting from point a to b in a fairly reasonable price for a 1 hour 40 minute flight,1
IndiGo,10.0,thank you indigo,Ashish Khokar,2021-09-10,yesterday 11 july i brought my 90 year old mother back and from entry to exit each member of indigo staff provided exemplary care from wheelchair to security to plane they took genuine care the surprise started by sujata politely asking if we would like front row seats which i had wanted but while booking couldnt get that gave us comfort in 2 hours flight and sujata accompanied us through security which often can be cumbersome other staff too helped selflessly cabin crew was kind covid protocols are followed to a t by indigo in bengaluru on arrival keertana helped and escorted all through till exit it made travel with a near blind wheelchair bound mother very doable thank you indigo way to go,1
IndiGo,1.0,obscene cancellationchange fees,T Patusa,2021-09-10,i have not flown on this flight yet its a future reservation that i have with them and need to cancel because my onwardreturn journey between mumbai and seychelles that was part of the overall travel itinerary was cancelled due to covid restrictions in seychelles for passengers from india so i need to cancel these indigo flights as i have no need to travel to mumbai and back now when i call the customer service line to cancel i get the following they mention flight fees and changes on their website but fail to mention that they charge these per passenger per flightsector when you need make changes or cancellations to your reservation for a 180 round trip flight booked for my wife and i from tirupati to mumbai and back they were saying i will get a refund of 28 even though im canceling almost 2 months in advance based on their usd cancellation fee of 45 that should be charged for cancellations made 4 days before departure i should receive a 135 refund or if they were strictly following this fee applied per person per flight then that would be 45 per person per way ie 45x4180 so i should not receive any refund but they make an arbitrary calculation that i get 28 refund they pretend to be a lowcost carrier thats friendly to the middle class in india but actually charge obscene cancellationchange fees,0
IndiGo,1.0,they should inform earlier,Khyati Sethia,2021-09-10,cancelled flight and informed just one day before my rtpcr report and money got wasted i was also able to do webcheck in but they cancelled the flight after that they should inform earlier,0
IndiGo,8.0,provided with a covid19 safety kit,S Venkatesh,2021-09-10,recently i flew on indigo on economy class from coimbatore international airport in india to indias capital citys new delhi indira gandhi intl airport  this is my second flight after the pandemic lock down things have changed a lot after the pandemic the online checkin and selection of seats which is chargeable has been made mandatory my flight was a bit behind the schedule departure time as a low cost airline there is no inflight entertainment and food have to be prebooked online and you also have the option to buy onboard with limited selection all the passengers seated in the aisle and window seats were provided with a covid19 safety kit that had a face shield a face mask and some sanitizers the passenger who were about to be seated in the middle seats were provided with ppe kits as i had prebooked the inflight meal i had to select from the list of available options and i had opted for a prepacked bottle of fruit juice and a bowl of prepacked readily made south indian food the food was above average even though it was a prepacked one,1
IndiGo,2.0,extremely bad experience,Amitansu Dasgupta,2021-09-10,pre purchased seat while booking was not allotted in boarding pass in flight pre purchased meal was not served flight attendant was non responsive to resolve issues finally asked to get in touch with ground staff to resolve issues extremely bad experience and will definitely try to opt for other options,0
IndiGo,10.0,passengers were given safety kits,Ankit Dubey,2021-03-17,the flight departed before time and passengers were given safety kits prior to boarding and the middle seat pax were asked to put the safety gown on i had prebooked my inflight meals and the snack box was sealed the cabin crew wore their safety gown and masks all the time and ensures all the pax wore masks throughout the flight i got the ticket in the best price and the legroom cabin cleanliness cabin crew ground staff and the inflight meals were all top class,1
IndiGo,10.0,i had a great experience flying indigo,D Reddy,2021-03-17,as always i had a great experience flying indigo it was a quick one day trip from lucknow to goa and also my first in over a year since the pandemic i was very impressed with the ground and cabin staff ensuring all the passengers maintained social distancing while boarding and in the cabin during flight before boarding all passengers were given a safety kit packet which included a face shieldface mask and 56 pouches of hand sanitizers also the best thing was that all the middle seat passengers were also made to wear the safety gown along with the face mask and face shield which is a good safety measure the inflight magazine wasnt available but understandable as they are trying to minimize the contact as much as possible water bottles were free of cost even though precovid indigo used to serve water in cups but its nice they are serving water bottles free of cost and also in addition to that they are served free tea and coffee as well snacks and hot food items were available for sale however i had pre booked my food item while making the booking and it was served in indigo branded pack and sealed and tasted as good as it looked the flight did depart 5 minutes behind schedule but i wont mind 5 minutes given indigo sanitizers their aircrafts before and after every flight so id rather depart late than departing unsure of the safety overall an amazing flight experience with indigo great price great safety and great legroom and tasty inflight food,1
IndiGo,5.0,cabin crew were nice helpful,K Sandi,2021-03-17,app is very nice looking easy to use and never had an issue i was able to book the ticket in no time interior of the flight requires some enhanced cleaning they enforced the ones occupying middle seat to wear ppe cabin crew were nice helpful paid attention to all the unwanted needs of unruly passengers i liked the bamboo cutleries which is environmentally friendly rather than the plastic ones flight reached delhi before the time and luggage came out on time everything was great except one major problem i had i prebooked my meal which was a paneer salad salad was served with a bread roll when i opened the bag i found the bread had mould  i showed it to a cabin crew and she was apologetic and offered any food drinks i want i declined her offer and returned the paneer salad,1
IndiGo,9.0,boarding started ahead of time,S Harshun,2021-03-17,we decided to go for a quick vacation within the state as we did not want to take any chances travelling outside any state and chose to go to mangalore which was a 50 minute short journey check in was smooth and the bag drop was done quickly aswell the flight boarding started ahead of time and the flight load was on the higher side departure and arrival were well ahead of schedule and indigo did the job of transporting from point a to point b the pilots updated the passengers on the flight details which was appreciated but it seems the crew were rushed with their announcements,1
IndiGo,2.0,such inexperienced and unprofessional airline staff,N Reddy,2021-03-17,me and my wife were headed for our honeymoon to maldives march 410 2021 but despite having all proper documentation pcr covid health etc we were stopped in kolkata by indigo airlines they gave us a hellish experience  finding faults and even accusing us of not knowing protocols i am a frequent international traveller she didnt even know where our arrival ticket was as it was lying in front of her she didnt give us any options nor reassurance or help she was intent on ruining our vacation my tired wife cried in despair i don’t like to berate somebody online but these kind of people need to be exposed such inexperienced and unprofessional airline staff shouldn’t be allowed to malign the good name of the company,0
IndiGo,1.0,wait for 12hrs to reach in dubai,H Kamil,2021-03-17,dubai to goa via mumbai passengers had to wait for 12hrs to reach in dubai due to technical issues they said and landed in oman but didn’t give a proper space to freshen up or to rest and haven’t provided and facilities and after reaching at mumbai at 1am they asked to wait 12 more hours to wait to catch the connection flight to goa without giving a space to rest no proper meal also provided it was 75hrs total flying time instead it took 30hrs,0

IndiGo,9.0,indigo does the job very well,H Vashun,2021-03-17,our initial flight which was supposed to be a direct flight from mumbai to kolkata was cancelled and so as an alternative the airline offered various alternatives one of which was via hyd which we took the airline claimed that the flight was cancelled due to covid restrictions but is clear that the flight was cancelled due to lack of good loads and so instead of the usual travel time of 25 hours the total flight duration was almost 6 hours which could have been better at least during the online checkin the airline didnt charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief both the flight segments themselves were quite okay and departed well on time even though some of the conduct of the passengers was questionable like not wearing the face shield  hazmat suit for the middle row seats even despite the crew reminding the passengers to wear it numerous times nowadays when flying low cost carriers it seems like a bus journey with wings where the airlines try to get as many passengers stuffed inside the aircraft as much as possible if you are a passenger who likes to travel in a bit of exclusivity and luxury without feeling claustrophobic about the number of people surrounding you you are better off travelling on other airlines but if however you prefer getting from point a to point b with slightly cheaper fares then indigo does the job very well,1
IndiGo,1.0,extremely dissatisfied with the customer service relations team,Milton Fernando,2021-03-17,extremely dissatisfied with the customer service relations team due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstance my flight from mumbai to london heathrow was cancelled and hence i wanted to cancel my flight from tuticorin to mumbai i had requested via email to honour and waive the cancellation charges but to no avail it would have been a gesture of goodwill to waive the charges at least a certain amount and not half the ticket price,0

IndiGo,10.0,thank you for a safe flight,V Harish,2020-11-09,bengaluru to mumbai due to the corona virus outbreak there was hardly any passengers travelling on this flight so check in was a breeze the check in agents were quite helpful and they had a bottle of hand sanitizers on their desks which was well appreciated the boarding commenced well before the scheduled time of departure and it was clear that travel was at a minimum as the flight was quite empty the crew were polite enough and even though i slept for most part of the flight the departure and arrival was well before time baggage retrieval was a breeze as there were hardly any passengers and this was a very uneventful flight fortunately the flight was not cancelled as there were numerous flights which got called off due to the pandemic so thank you for a safe flight,1

IndiGo,5.0,the leg space was too small,A Mahdesh,2020-03-05,raipur to kolkata i know indigo is a low cost carrier but the only good thing is ontime performance their cabin crew were reluctant to provide a full glass of water i do not have any options to select seats during checking using kiosk and was randomly assigned a middle seat of last row the leg space was too small for me,0
IndiGo,1.0,trolley with broken handle,A Kanavarma,2020-03-05,ranchi to bangalore i received my trolley with broken handle at the destination counter they didnt do anything to compensate this after complaining no action as if nothing happened,0

IndiGo,1.0,don’t fly with indigo,Anastasia Kolesnik,2020-03-05,dubai to thiruvananthapuram this is the worst airlines in the world they are liars and they are careless if your healthmindluggage is important to you i do not suggest to ever travel with them they lost my luggage they did not refund the money for the cancelled flight and they were lying to me that they found my luggage just to mislead me and make me go away i hate this airline they hurt me emotionally and physically 3 days spent at the airport just looking for a bag i booked another flight and they told me my bag will be loaded when i was boarding they said my bag isn’t there and no one knows where is it they are the worst in the world and if you’re thinking ah they’re cheaper then others that’s ok  its wrong that’s what i was thinking and trust me it’s not worst the experience i had with them don’t fly with indigo,0

IndiGo,1.0,allocated seats in four different rows,S Martha,2020-03-05,hyderabad to coimbatore i’m usually not the one to write reviews but today’s experience mandates a review was travelling with family four passengers booked under the same pnr reached the checkin counter 15 hours prior to departure yet we are allocated seats in four different rows what’s the logic and reason of booking under the same pnr and arriving early only to be left to the mercy of the staff who doesn’t even consider helping us find at least 2 seats together and smirks at our misfortune,0
IndiGo,7.0,content with their services,S Vanesh,2020-03-05,kolkata to bengaluru by indigo checkin for the flight was smoothly done via the kiosks as well as the baggage security screening the staff at the counter had informed in advance that the flight was going to be delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming flight which was good however on the notification screens it was still displayed that the flight was on time and this was only updated when the boarding was around the corner the flight was delayed by an hour so that meant instead of reaching the destination at 2310 hours the arrival was at 2350 hours which was kind of late at the boarding gate there was an irate passenger who was taking his frustration out on the staff but the staff handled the situation extremely well the boarding process was hurried as the crew tried to compensate for the delay which was much appreciated the rest of the flight was pretty uneventful however during deboarding the crew were polite and wished goodbye to me but not to everyone probably due to the fact that the crew were not expecting the rest of the passengers to thank them baggage was also retrieved in a safe condition as a paying customer i am content with their services and even though things like delays can happen in a congested area like india they get the job done,1
IndiGo,9.0,by and large a flawless flight,N Sharvin,2020-03-05,bengaluru to kolkata on this early morning flight i had arrived at the airport much ahead of schedule and despite that i still managed to check in and print the boarding pass selecting my seat which saves on the money if one were to check online baggage drop was easily done and the agent at the desk was with a pleasant demeanor boarding started ahead if schedule on this flight and was warmly greeted by the flight attendants as it was during the christmas time the background music was related to the holidays which was a nice touch departure was on time and the rest of the flight passed off uneventfully arrival was on time and was able to collect my baggage as well only thing i observed was that the key chain of my bag was missing even though the contents of the bag appear to be intact and i am not sure if the airline or any of the baggage handlers might be responsible for the loss of the keychain but it could quite easily have resulted in the loss of any other items so i am not sure this aspect has the only negative over what was by and large a flawless flight,1
IndiGo,1.0,flight was delayed,D Nelson,2019-12-13,indigo claims that they are an ontime departure and arrival airlines this is a joke i have flown indigo from nagpur to pune for the fifth time this month and yet again this flight was delayed as it always does this time the delay is more than 5 hours and i am writing this review while waiting for the delayed flight this particular routes flight always gets delayed and by now indigo should have taken note and tried to fix the root cause of the issue how can the same route flight get delayed always every single time i have flown from nagpur to pune with indigo there have been delays on top of that there is no refund or alternatives offered for the inconvenience caused due to delays i could have definitely preferred some other airlines if there were options available for night departures unfortunately only indigo fits into my schedule and i have to choose it for business purpose i hope indigo takes note and corrects this issue,0

IndiGo,8.0,my favorite budget airline,T Taylor,2019-12-13,india – goa goi to udaipur udr the colour indigo is fresh and happy – even saying the word out loud makes me smile the airline indigo is no different keeping in mind that this is a lowcost carrier it was virtually impossible to tack any negativity onto this airline they embrace a fun outlook on just about everything from their inflight magazine titled ‘6e’ pronounced ‘sexy’ to their luggage buggies on the tarmac called ‘ground force’ yes the seats are narrow no worse than any other budget airline and they don’t recline which is a blessing when you’re trying to watch a video on your tabletphone – that’s right the seats do not have monitors builtin you pay for food and beverages it’s the norm now but the prices are fair and some of the snacks are served in fun packaging that you might even want to take home i know i did i still have my ‘nut case’ blue is my favorite colour and now indigo is my favorite budget airline four thumbs up,1
IndiGo,2.0,checkin was fairly nonchalant,A Carden,2019-12-13,doha to kathmandu via delhi the staff in doha assisted me very well but when i arrived in delhi was when the terrible experience started after we got off from the flight passenger with an onward journey to ktm were asked to just wait at the arrival gate exit without any explanation of why we have to wait and for how long we have to wait we were held for about 20 minutes without enough seat there at ktm airport checkin was fairly nonchalant again no smiles and then the ground staff did a hurried security check for restricted items at the aircraft stairs which has been done already after emigration or they could have been done before we board the bus the staff is asking the passengers to open our bags,0
IndiGo,10.0,happy with the service provided,Madan Kashyap,2019-12-13,new delhi to dehradun with indigo very superior staff around in here happy with the service provided by the airline and the ground staff as well it has always been a pleasant journey great experience,1

IndiGo,2.0,staff is very poor,Arshad Noor Siddiquee,2019-09-17,delhi to nagpur all my experiences with this airline are very poor specially the courtesy of the staff is very poor the legspace and the seats are very uncomfortable one must choose to fly with this airline only when there is no alternative the staff right at the checkin to even the customer care is so rude the boast to fly on time but at what cost they maintain the schedule at the cost of inconvenience of the guest onboard food is horrible overall one should prefer any other available alternative,1

IndiGo,1.0,restriction on carryon weight,G Sawyer,2019-07-21,bangalore to chennai this is the only airline i have flown that has such a hard restriction on carryon weight 7kg per person period this makes it impossible to carry a laptop bag and a carryon with clothes even other lowcost airlines eg jetstar will allow you to pay for extra carryon weight as a business traveler flying 5 times in 8 days this is a colossal waste of time waiting for checked bags at every stop not to mention the risk of an eventual misplaced bag,0

IndiGo,1.0,one of the luggage was lost,Arathi Pv,2019-07-21,delhi to kochi on may 31 i reached the airport at around 600 am and checked in at the emergency counter i had a friend also traveling with me whose luggage was less than 15 kg i asked the indigo staff if my excess luggage can be adjusted with him staff  told me to pay the extra amount i immediately agreed to pay hence as per the baggage policy i paid 40010kg 4000rs on arriving at kochi airport after a 40minute wait i discovered that one of the luggage was lost and reported to the baggage claim representative after waiting for more than 30 minutes she crosschecked with the boarding pass and confirmed me that the bag of 10kg is missing i spoke to the indigo staff and have no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage one of the senior officials of indigo called me on june 9th and confirmed that the bag weight was 10kg and a refund of 3500inr will be given i expressed a complete dissatisfaction as i paid 4000rs extra for the same bag the staff promised me that he will check with the finance department and revert back but i havent received any call yet i find it unprofessional how such a large airline like indigo can lose luggage  to add insult to injury i am faced with obtaining compensation for those items that are far less than their worth,0
IndiGo,10.0,cabin crew with genuine smile,Ankit Dubey,2019-07-21,this airline has never disappoints me even though you dont get free meals however i had booked my meals and they were very tasty and also their check in and hand baggage allowance is similar to that of many full service carriers and their on time performance puts other airlines to shame the one hour flight from jaipur to lucknow was on time and landed 5 minutes before arrival time the ground staff was courteous and so was the cabin crew with genuine smile,1
IndiGo,2.0,already running late for flight,P Chalnish,2019-07-21,ahmadabad to mumbai total chaos paid for extra luggage but receipt printer not working a girl trying to fix but she has no clue how to fix asked to wait 5 10 15 20 minutes but printer did not work she filled up manual receipt and handed over to me by this time already running late for flight she allowed 2 small carry on but  supervisor did not allow at security checkpoint now i have to start from square one scan bag bag drop off a girl at bag drop off wants to charge for extra luggage but printer is not working and i am running out of time supervisor came things did not work bag was checked in without any charge i rushed through security heard my name announced on pa before last call rushed to boarding gate,0
IndiGo,9.0,really helpful and welcoming,L Bursell,2019-05-31,i was in india on a holiday and i decided to fly with indigo from mangalore to mumbai the ground staff and the cabin crew were really helpful and welcoming the inflight meal options were limited but it was a standard domestic flight like menu so no complaints there the flight was tidy and the journey was very comfortable the best part about the flight was the punctuality overall it was an excellent experience and if i would need to travel by a domestic flight in india the next time i know which airline i am going to look out for,1
IndiGo,10.0,how helpful they were,Ayushi Dixit,2019-05-31,i accidentally interchanged the boarding date and ended up messing up my flight tickets for june 2019 my tickets were under the category which cannot be rescheduled so i panicked as the amount i paid was over 20000 rupees and with my previous experience with domestic airlines i was sure i am losing all the money and would be asked to rebook the entire journey much fortunately i called indigo and got connected to this very helpful person who was so patient with my panic state and assisted me with all my queries and infact rescheduled the tickets considering they were booked a few minutes ago i cannot thank this person and indigo enough to explain how helpful they were towards my situation and how efficiently they fixed this issues,1
IndiGo,2.0,no options for hot meals,S Marbanian,2019-05-31,delhi to istanbul via doha we had booked the xl seats in the 1st row for rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey but realized what a mistake that was first of all indigo added a stopover in doha which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking became nearly 10 hours the seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights with just a few more rows added in the back since the a321 is longer than the a320 this means that they use the same seats with just about 4 cm of foam padding the inflight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased and the best food you can buy onboard is cup noodles made with hot water even air asia which is a much more lcc provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at doha during which they park in a remote bay and open the doors for crew and cleaning this means that if you are seated near the front of the plane you will be exposed to hot desert winds of qatar for about an hour on top of this even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row emergency exits are paid seats they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then only to get scammed during the flight like this on top of this the crew treat the first row like the toilet waiting area since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on but the crew instead of sending them back to their seat make them sit in the first row which is a paid row,0
IndiGo,1.0,didnt have a printout of boarding pass,Aastha Gupta,2019-05-31,bengaluru to jaipur i had done web check in and had my boarding pass as pdf in my phone as i couldnt get a print out upon reaching the airport i was not allowed to print the boarding pass they didnt have to give the boarding pass just print the pdf that i had the worst part is if they had not wasted my time in queues when i had already mentioned i was in a hurry i could have gone outside and gotten a printout i missed my flight just because i didnt have a printout of my boarding pass even though i had the pdf there has to be some understanding they should guide us properly,0
IndiGo,6.0,got what was expected,D Alagiah,2019-05-31,jaipur to lucknow i got what was expected and that was low cost flying and the flight was on time and thats what really matters the crew was courteous and overall an average flight experience however some seat covers were torn i hope they clean their aircraft before flights,0
IndiGo,5.0,a box of cashew nuts,P Densah,2019-05-31,jaipur to mumbai ticket was booked under corporate fare with meal included flight time was 520pm and total duration from jaipur to mumbai was 1hr 55 min the cabin crew started serving refreshments at 550pm my seat was 20a the cabin crew reached my seat at 640pm 15 mins prior to landing the first officer announced landing time of 655 pm the meal was complimentary and being corporate meal it should have been ready but the cabin crew member said she will get back to me with chicken sandwich which she never came back she even refused to serve anything hot beverage andor meal to me and few other passengers on seats nearby my seat since we were near to landing time how was it passengers fault that meal was served or about to be served at time of landing i raised this issue with the cabin crew head and all i got as meal after landing while getting out of aircraft was a box of cashew nuts,0
IndiGo,6.0,crew is very nice,N Rafe,2019-05-31,male to mumbai 3hr flight with 1 class only  no premium or business crew is very nice and service oriented although its a low cost airline we booked what they called 6e  food drinks and priority during tickets reservation we got a rice spicy and soft drinks i would not say it was good and for our kids they served the same  so it was kind of waste if time and money  no entertainment on board,0
IndiGo,1.0,lovely experience until today,I Tavoni,2019-05-31,kolkata to delhi i have been in india for few months and travelled with indigo few times and i have always had a lovely experience until today i’ve arrived to kolkata as i went to drop my bag at the checkin desk a barrier was lower so i took a shortcut and stepped over it straight after staff come up to me and with a intimidating attitude asked me is everything ok at first i didn’t realise but then i told me in that i should not step over the barrier as a matter of security honestly i felt very embarrassed so i apologies few seconds after i saw some older guy doing it but staff looked away then another guy did it in front of him and staff smiled away so i asked staff why it was ok for some people to do it and not for me it was then become aggressive and rude so i decide to let the argument go he should be fair with all no just pick arguments with foreigners so that he can feel good and embarrassing customer in front of all i hope indigo can address this with staff and provide him with a customer service training he is the face of indigo when people arrive at the airport and people like him can ruin the reputation of indigo then on the flight they didn’t have changed for cash payments and instead wanted me to buy more things that was pathetic they offer a service they should make sure they have changed it was the first flight in the morning and i was seating 1st row and they didn’t have changes,0
IndiGo,1.0,very unprofessional,S Gordon,2019-05-31,tutocurin to chennai with indigo very pathetic very unprofessional in handling the excess weight felt like i was cheated i have almost traveled with all major airlines but have never had such a bad experience as today with indigo i would give minus five stars if i have the option to do so,0

IndiGo,3.0,the timings were good,Sameer Phatak,2019-04-18,flew from mumbai to bangalore last week opted for indigo as the timings were good check in was a little slow and so was boarding  their staff at the gates was asking people to check their bags in at the boarding gate so there was some confusion the aircraft was a slightly older one seats were okay since this was a corporate booking got a xl seat over the wings meal was preadded as a corporate booking perk  food was ok had to remind the staff for a cup of tea never got one as when the crew did care to drop by the pilot had already announced them to secure for landing,0
IndiGo,10.0,staff were smiling,D Vartya,2019-04-18,delhi to kuala lumpur i had paid for ff package so checkin was smooth even though baggage allowance was 20kg on ticket but they allow me to carry extra as a result my one hand bag went inside so i was free to walk on airport i got checkin lounge where i can rest and have some food at odd hours and went to gate boarding was already open one hour before departure and we were on our seat 30 minutes and gate close as every one had boarded boarding was smooth no drama flight was ready for take off and at that time it was advise that there is problem with aircraft and hence the flight need to abandon and change of aircraft and brought aircraft back to gate spend another 3 hours and finally took off i can say that they had managed transition very smoothly aircraft were clean and toilets were clean too staff were smiling and food was nice tea and upma which was preordered flight landed on time cant ask more on budget airline so it all depends upon what you pay upfront to get service,1

IndiGo,1.0,our terminal had changed,Ishita Bhowmick,2019-02-12,on may 30th 2018 my husband mother and myself were supposed to catch our flight from delhi to goa with indigo however the day before our flight we received a message stating that our terminal had changed due to renovations in the airport my husband had called the airlines to confirm and was told that our terminal had in fact changed once we arrived at the delhi airport security wouldn’t let us inside the airport and he kept telling us we were in the wrong terminal we told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change but he still didn’t want to let us in and asked us to go to the indigo customer care outside of the airport when we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one indigo agent that was there after we explained the situation to the gentleman he called his manager to help us the manager took at least 1520 minutes before he came down after the agent called numerous times when we reexplained the situation the manager told us he can’t help us and left midconversation baffling both my husband and i with such horrible customer service especially from someone in management the manager left another agent to deal with us that was even less helpful by this time boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldn’t do anything we asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that she said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed by this time all early flights were gone and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to goa for may 30th were booked we booked our flight with fly air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at delhi we called the hotel in goa to advise them we wouldn’t make it to the hotel that day but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day but unfortunately we couldn’t because of the service from indigo airlines and wrong information given to us by them we had to spend 6 times the price of our original flights lost 1 day of hotel in goa and had to book another extra night in delhi,0

IndiGo,1.0,given wrong information by staff,Mary Tawadros,2019-02-12,trivandrum to doha terrible experience with booking process and customer service from the airline we were given wrong information by staff and we were denied boarding for our flight because apparently there was no transfer desk at our transit airport it cost us our return ticket unnecessary stress at the airport and an extra usd 2000 for alternative and last minute flights to make it back home upon returning home we made several attempts to reach management to address our case  the responses were slow if any and unprofessional with no attention to our case we received standard replies and it has been almost a month now since we have received any updates about our complaint,0

IndiGo,1.0,52 mins to receive the luggage,Sandeep Kulkarni,2018-12-21,pune to ahmedabad although indigo is good in time management and on time departure they have deteriorated in terms of customer service  although the flight was on time it took 52 mins to receive the luggage also it was surprising that they put the luggage of two adjacently arriving flights on the same belt this is just not to allow the belt to remain empty the luggage keeps coming so much less in number and the passengers keep staring at the belt expecting their luggage to comethe attitude of the ground staff is rude  also the crew members are not friendly enough  kpi of on time is important as a performance indicator but should not be at the cost of passenger satisfaction,0
IndiGo,8.0,crew were super friendly,Jay Jayant,2018-12-21,i flew with my family from delhi to guwahati indigo crew were super friendly and the flight was pretty comfortable service was good and attendants responded to requests although the aircraft was nearly full one of the hostess was nice enough and very professional she actually made small talk with me about their service their smiling face and nice humor made our travels much more pleasant,1

IndiGo,1.0,inflexible airline and understaffed,P Singh,2018-12-21,absolutely inflexible airline and understaffed there was a misprint in the name due to autocorrect i showed 3 different ids passport drivers license from india drivers license from another country so that they can correct my name but to no avail they are completely understaffed and unprofessional about handling the case it took 40 minutes just to reach the ticketing counter to explain my case and then i was left with over 1 hour before departure rather than trying to fix the issue they were just trying to get more money by asking me to book a fresh ticket since this was happening 1 hour before departure i could not even cancel my ticket had they been quick about it i could have corrected the issue and boarded the flight but instead i had to book a new ticket for an airline later in the day and lost money on the previous one too with a security lapse i was allowed in the airportname on id not matching my ticket this was surprising in the first place rather taking this case to fix their security issues they were still bent on just asking me to book a fresh ticket no wonder there is a huge room for improvement but instead of fixing those the involved people are just concerned about extracting money from consumers absolutely unsatisfied with the situation,0
IndiGo,1.0,measuring the handbags,H Gadesse,2018-10-04,i was flying from dubai to bangalore and the luggage policy is 30 kgs checkin and 7 kgs hand luggage  my checkin luggage was 22 kgs and i thought i would move my extra kgs to the checkin but at the checkin counter even though i put both pieces of luggage together the guy told me it’s ok you can put it down and didn’t ask to measure my hand luggage which is what they normally do however after immigration and security just when i was about to board the flight they had another scale and were measuring the handbags and wanted me to pay 60 aed 1100 rs per kg they said if i don’t pay i cannot get on the flight they were even charging people for stuff they bought in dutyfree,0

IndiGo,5.0,nothing turned up in chennai,John Maynard,2018-10-04,i used indigo for the first time yesterday all went very well but for the very last leg back to chennai i had requested a wheelchair for all legs of the journey but nothing turned up in chennai eventually the crew left the captain left copilot gone i had been told to wait so eventually i asked again and the ground staff man said everyone was gone yes i said except me so after a long wait someone turned up with a childs wheelchair im 6 foot plus after a further long wait a wheelchair turned up surely any staff must ensure that passengers are taken care of before leaving the vessel for their own comfort,1
IndiGo,8.0,professional and caring,K Mahuddin,2018-10-04,hyderabad to sharjah shortly after boarding the above flight i was having dizziness after 2 hrs of boarding i realized the vomiting sensation  was prepared to use the toilet  in front of toilet i collapsed like a blackout however the flight crew done everything by calmly and professionally organizing medical attention cabin crew made an announcement to other co passengers if any dr available to take care of him and luckily dr was available  he checked everything  made me more comfortable indigo is indeed a very professional and caring organization,1
IndiGo,1.0,wouldn’t recommend,G Eardly,2018-10-04,i had the opportunity to fly with indigo on the 15th of august 2018 from doha to mumbai always having flown qatar airways i had to choose indigo due to the time slot well a low cost airline in really had no expectations but at least a decent and hassle free experience as they claim to give i checked in at the counters and got my boarding pass and i had a handbag of 6kgs which is well below their limit of 7kgs i purchased duty free which was about 3 kgs here comes the tricky part the staff at the boarding gate have a portable weighing scale through which they check the weight of the handbags i have no issues with that however i wasn’t informed at the counters about 7kgs handbag allowance being inclusive of duty free the staff at the boarding gate qas staff were rude they do not even try to be polite of courteous and straight away give ultimatums saying throw away the duty free go back to duty free and return it however if you do no return in 20 minutes we will offload you from the flight they forced me to pay 60 riyal per kg for the excess baggage which i was carrying i wouldn’t recommend this airline unless a last resort or a complete emergency one can only expect low quality service from a low cost airline thank you indigo for the hassle free experience,0
IndiGo,7.0,experience was good,Chinmay Natu,2018-10-04,singapore to pune via chennai it was reasonably good flight specially it was on time connection was swift ground staff was little rude but cabin staff was very good i think it was quite value for money service as it was cheap ticket to singapore quite minimalist flight service as expected for a cheap ticket overall experience was good and will definitely give it a go next time thanks,1
IndiGo,9.0,totally recommend it,Arsha Ignatius,2018-10-04,mumbai to kochi on time not a minute late everything was on time service is great food options are limited the blue is very pleasing to the eye wellorganised and a reliable airline totally recommend it,1
IndiGo,1.0,paying for the excess baggage,Jaganathan Venkatesh,2018-10-04,delhi to coimbatore i have flown with indigo loads of times and have regularly recommended it to many i have never had a bad experience in all of my trips and was really happy until my recent trip i had booked my seats under student discount which allowed an additional baggage of 10kgs free of charge during my through leg from del to cjb this promotion was honored and i paid for whatever excess i had excluding the 15kg10kg allowance but they would not agree that i had this promotion during my return leg and would not agree or believe me that i availed this in my first leg i was astounded when the rep said there was nothing in the notes regarding the promotion how can it be possible that you allow different baggage allocations for different legs i ended up paying for the excess baggage which i had packed in anticipation of availing the 10 kg student discount it was never about the money for me but indigo let me down in not acknowledging my promotion status,0
IndiGo,10.0,indigo is such a great airline,Suramya Naik,2018-10-04,i was travelling from delhi to vadodara in july 2018 through indigo unfortunately our flight from san francisco to delhi via shanghai got delayed and we missed the 510 am flight from delhi to vadodara the indigo staff at terminal 2 acted very helpful they offered me to book in the next flight to vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us as we were tired of traveling from sfo and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible there was a flight to ahmedabad at 740 am and we urged the indigo staff to book us in that flight they mentioned that the sector ie destination was different and therefore the change fees would be higher i said no issue as we were really in hurry there was another problem though that flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 620 am the indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if i would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight i would lose more money they offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1 but with little time we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi we barely reached to terminal at 635 am we had to get our tickets modified checked in and boarding passes printed by 640 am to get into the ahemdabad flight that is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state i requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get ahmedabad flight she immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed in couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance she ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast then we ran to checkin area she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes we could get the boarding passes just in time then she ran with us to the security area asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate we got to the gate as last passengers entering we could not have done it without this staff we now realized why indigo is such a great airline it is because of the great employees,1
IndiGo,8.0,we enjoyed our trip,Karan Chauhan,2018-10-04,mumbai to udaipur excellent service and air hostess were polite and helpful it was a really nice flightthanks to pilot and the crew members we enjoyed our trip,1
IndiGo,8.0,good service and price,Mamata Dalai,2018-06-28,delhi to visakhapatnam good service and price but why not charge ₹200300 extra on any flight and serve a free meal snacks are ok but a meal will do better  also  moving to terminal 2 at delhi airport was not a good idea no windows to watch outside for those who love planespotting also there are no good passenger facilities available in terminal 2,1
IndiGo,9.0,full marks for their service,Arindam Mahapatra,2018-06-28,bhubaneswar to mumbai via hyderabad as usual full marks for their service in the aircraft from checkin to the boarding although flight was delayed due to bad weather in bhubaneswar they also gave constant updates about the status of the planes arrival also otherwise no complaints at all about their service ,1

IndiGo,1.0,an excess baggage of 5kg,J Masim,2018-06-28,doha to kochi the check in staff were unprofessional and impolite i had an excess baggage of 5kg which i took back and repacked without any hesitation yet they behaved as if i was handling drugs i took back only one baggage to repack leaving the other to them to check in coming back after repacking which is a struggle at the airport  these check in staff kept yelling why i kept the bag there,0
IndiGo,9.0,a value for money indeed,Arindam Mahapatra,2018-06-28,bhubaneshwar to mumbai indigo being a lowcost nofrills airline is a value for money indeed although their inflight menu is bit expensive one can bring their food from home also which also save some money from ground handling to the crews services it was an excellent service the students fare scheme is a boon indeed being a student i always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6 basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance i also prefer this airlines as they are the most punctual airlines looking forward to travel on indigo,1

IndiGo,1.0,please improve your service,S Jabathra,2018-06-28,mumbai to raipur the fare for extra luggage is too high no food is provided during travelling i don’t think it’s worth paying 6000 for each flight and not getting any facilities  please improve your service,0
IndiGo,2.0,lack of flexibility,S Richardson,2018-04-27,i travel with indigo a lot and about half the time i regret it they have all sorts of arbitrary rules that dont affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience for example a few times ive arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day every time they refuse despite having plenty of space  apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane lack of flexibility and customer orientation on this airline is consistently staggeringly bad and it really irritates my sense of efficiency and reasonableness,0
IndiGo,2.0,delayed by more than 5 hours,S Rajur,2018-04-27,kochi to hyderabad via mumbai i earlier travelled to cochin it was delayed by 13 hours this time they directly rescheduled my travel i was supposed to travel from cochin to hyderabad via chennai but they had rerouted me to mumbai then to hyderabad before rescheduling directly they should have given me options of cancellation or showing next available flight options i got delayed by more than 5 hours who would want to suffer without sleep for purely airlines mistake  when i ask for compensation they  say you should have called before starting your travel,0
IndiGo,2.0,poor quality of ground staff,Gokal Chittaranjan,2018-04-27,bangalore to singapore horrible experience with check in staff at bangalore we had an onward flight from singapore to jakarta on singapore airlines the check in staff refused to check us in saying we did not have singapore visas we explained that we were transiting at singapore so did not need a visa they refused to accept i explained that at singapore it is possible to freely transfer between terminals t2  t3 without needing to pass immigration they refused to agree and insisted we required a singapore visa after much discussion they allowed us to board after they realized we possessed valid us  other visas wereached singapore and there is no requirement to pass immigration imagine if we did not possess other visas would we have not been allowed to travel sad to see the poor quality of ground staff at indigo,0
IndiGo,2.0,missed my delhi  dubai flight,B Marala,2018-04-27,udaipur to dubai via delhi i was travelling with my spouse mother and infant udaipur  delhi flight was delayed more than 25 hours and because of this i missed my delhi  dubai flight no one from indigo was there to assist i struggled for 5 hours at delhi airport with my kid they made me run between the counters after struggle of whole night they arranged to fly in another flight but only for two people i had to travel with my kid and mother leaving my spouse at delhi airport they arranged a flight for my spouse after 12 hours,0
IndiGo,1.0,the flight i booked was cancelled,J Reddy,2018-04-27,i am a frequent domestic flyer and several times i have traveled with indigo apart from one or two exceptions every time the flight i booked was cancelled and i was rebooked on another flight it was alright when the rebooking was done for another flight at the same time but lately the rebooked flights are at very inconvenient times as a female passenger traveling alone i could not accept the revised time of 2150 reaching my destination at 2305 for my last booked flight the only other alternative for me is a flight one day later not to mention the unexpected delays in airport i do not recommend indigo flights the chances of getting your entire schedule messed up is pretty high with indigo,0
IndiGo,10.0,sincere thanks and appreciation,Ravi Pullanikattil,2018-04-27,my wife travelled on indigo flight 6e459 from mumbai to chennai on 2032018 she arrived late at the airport in mumbai there was a flash strike by uber which she booked earlier and she had to take an auto at the last moment to travel from thane to the domestic airport the indigo staff at the mumbai airport were very helpful in arranging to board the aircraft at the last moment she was travelling alone and had no knowledge of hindi the ground staff of indigo also arranged to send her luggage in another aircraft travelling to chennai we had a few tense moments till she arrived safely here at chennai to our pleasant surprise the baggage was also delivered personally by indigo staff at chennai within an hour i wish to place on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to all the indigo staff who helped her out both at mumbai and chennai,1

IndiGo,9.0,as always exemplary cabin service,H Advani,2018-04-27,my umpteenth flight with indigo in the past four years almost always bangkokpunebangkok via calcutta as always exemplary cabin service efficient check in service this time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb i checked in and was asked if i had a powerpac in my luggage and i said no while waiting at the departure gate to board the indigo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my checkin luggage and that there was something suspicious inside they asked me to exit security surrendering my passport at immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled an indigo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held i opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operators suspicions was a litre of oil i was carrying they opened the container examined it declared it passed and i relocked my luggage all this time i was very nervous that i might miss my flight the indigo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that i would not he reescorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me he assuaged my nervousness stayed with me till i went through security and immigration again escorted me to the plane where i was the last passenger to board a exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an indigo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal many many thanks on the downside no foreigner arrival cards on board the flight from bkk to cal and no thai immigration forms on the flight from cal to bkk,1
IndiGo,9.0,very professional cabin crew,V Talapu,2018-02-26,dubai to singapore via chennai new aircraft very professional cabin crew they assist me at the check in to put my luggage to singapore via chennai transit in chennai was very smooth despite the procedures of indian police  checking three times our passports but all went ok on time flights i will fly with them on this route if needed,1
IndiGo,6.0,seats were a bit tight,Nafis Ahmed Raiyan,2018-02-26,flew indigo from kolkata to new delhi the checkin process was smooth and the baggage handling went well i later found out as i had a lite ticket which was cheaper i had to pay extra for my checked baggage i did that a bus took us to our aircraft the plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time the seats were a bit tight and legroom wasnt that good so i was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight the headrest of the seat also wasnt that comfortable but you know you cant expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrowbody type with indigo you have to pay for food if you are flying economy i ordered coffee and a tandoori chicken sandwich from my judgement the cost was a bit much for food of that quality the sandwich was cold you even have to call flight attendants for water every time which in my opinion would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle the planes airconditioning had troubles so it was a bit hot at last the plane landed on new delhi after 2hr 5min experience could have been a little better even if it was economyclass,1
IndiGo,6.0,the flight was delayed,K Patmar,2018-02-26,mumbai to bangalore this is the second time im booking indigo from mumbai and both times the flight was delayed the scheduled take off was 1545h and take off was 1725h for the flight both times ive missed being where i was supposed to on time,0
IndiGo,8.0,crew service pretty good,Arul Prakash Samathuvamani,2018-02-26,flew indigo from chennai to madurai the flight was a pretty short one one hour during that time these are the things that i felt about the airline 1 check in the lines were long the number of counters were pretty reasonable but could be increased considering the number of flights indigo operates my advice arrive early 2 aircraft neat clean aircraft no problems 3 crew service pretty good up to standards 4 ground support i didnt face any trouble and the staff were pretty helpful too 5 on board meal its not complementary you have to buy it tasted good for the money 6 punctuality ontime no issues there 7 communications book online you would get all the information via sms even the boarding gate information,1
IndiGo,5.0,quite careless these days,Shubhi Singh,2018-02-26,chennai to raipur via hyderabad indigo is being quite careless these days they mess up things and all we get to hear is sorry for the inconvenience mam recently while booking the tickets i had selected a xl seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the xl seats including my fathers so today when we went to get our boarding passes they said sorry mam all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people cant handle it properly,1
IndiGo,3.0,waiting for some imaginary flight,G Shakari,2018-02-26,bangalore to mumbai my flight 6e 464 was scheduled for departure at 920am on 30 december and is finally boarding at 345 pm in between this many flights for mumbai has flown and indigo crew remained clueless about this particular flight and spoke rude to passengers who were enquiring after the delay till 240pm the airline stopped sending any information to passengers via sms or call  at some point we were thinking as if we were waiting for some imaginary flight  the refreshments were announced only at 1230pm when most passengers had arranged their meals,0
IndiGo,5.0,respects passengers valuable time,Praveen Sharma,2018-02-26,indigo flight scheduled at 930am from hyderabad to ranchi has been delayed 3 hours 30 minutes on december 25th 2017 i am still not sure how long it would take me to finally board my flight today i have a family event to attend but i think i wont be able to attend it  it would be a customer delight if airline respects passengers valuable time and value for money i have been a valued indigo customer but today i am sorry to say indigo customer centric ideologies are fading away these days,0
IndiGo,1.0,cheating elderly people,D Narash,2018-02-26,kolkata to mumbai i had a wheelchair passenger indigo provided no help getting onto the flight to mumbai on nov 15 she had to walk to the gate they issued the boarding pass but didnt wait for us and closed the gate 35 minutes before departure they then charged me extra rs6500 to get us on to another flight i have noticed the exact same happening to another senior citizen couple at the mumbai airport on nov 28th when i objected they issued two tickets to the couple for free indigo seems to be cheating elderly people using this technique,0
IndiGo,2.0,flight service is not good,U Patel,2018-02-26,hyderabad to bengaluru travel time check in procedure check out procedure and baggage collection are smooth and good inside flight service is not good our company has booked the ticket along with meals as well i am not aware of it i didnt check my boarding pass properly for special service crew members did not inform me about my meals while going to bangalore in return journey to hyderabad they provided 1 cookies box rs50 1coke rs100 we pay more money for meals at the time of booking while not receiving the service we paid for,1

IndiGo,9.0,an impeccable flight,H Advani,2017-11-20,bangkok to pune via kolkata as usual on this run a route i have flown close to 30 times in the past 6 years an almostflawless flight the only problem being no arrival cards on board for nonindian nationals thus needlessly spending a much longer time in queue at kolkata immigration other than that an impeccable flight especially the superb cabin crew,1
IndiGo,1.0,as a worst experience,Gaurav Surwade,2017-11-20,  goa to mumbai it was a worst experience we had at goa airport while travelling back to bombay we got to indigo counter at 43mins prior however we were denied for boarding as we were 2 mins late and were asked to pay difference of 10500rs for next flight we tried requesting the ground staff but they were arrogant and didnt show any respect or courtesy it seemed like we have to live on their mercy to get on board to get back to bombay as it was way below self respect we decided to book another flight with air india and got back home it was most inferior action by the indigo staff which could have been avoided,0
IndiGo,10.0,provided me as much help,S Chhatwani,2017-11-20,  bangalore to mumbai i was not feeling well and air hostess provided me as much help as she can during my  journey i am very much impressed with this behavior of staff towards passengers and i will be a frequent flyer of indigo thanks indigo for choosing such a helpful and lovely staff,1

IndiGo,5.0,seats were pretty cramped,Ashish Menon,2017-11-20,  journey from kochi to dubai seats were pretty cramped we asked for an aisle seat and the adjacent seat to that middle seat in this case as it was 3x3 but they gave us both an aisle seat that was still ok the passage area was not wide enough as you have to adjust yourself when an air hostess passes through the seat was well cramped the storage area was good its a budget airlines with the cost of ticket of a normal airlines only benefit was that we have 30 kgs each the storage area on above the seats was pretty wide staff and service was pretty average  average experience,0
IndiGo,10.0,friendly and professional,G Marezy,2017-11-20,  dubai to trivandrum we had a eventful day flying from dubai to trivandrum first upon check in we were told that we lacked a return ticket out of the country so our visa would not be valid the check in lady was very friendly and explained it very calmly so my son and i went to book a flight out of the country returned to the check in counter where the lady saw us and waved us over and let us jump the que we proceeded to security where the staff was friendly and gave clear directions to passengers who did not know the rules yet after security however things got exciting again while presenting our boarding pass i heard the staff talk to each other and we were told there was something in our bag that caught their attention all was said in an extremely friendly manner while we racked our brains trying to imagine what was in the suitcase i was allowed down to the tarmac where i opened the suitcase and it was examined it turned out to be a door stop i brought the staff were friendly during all of this and let us into the plane with a smile the flight itself was very nice the seats were more comfortable and spacious then our previous flights with pegasus all in all the staff was extremely friendly and professional,1
IndiGo,9.0,offered genuine hospitality,Mohammed Nishal,2017-11-20,  doha to kochi via mumbai i was having least expectation for this early morning flight but crew on board offered genuine hospitality and big smile they seems to be attentive and happy to operate this flight and seating in the forward cabin crew working in the forward cabin did a good job on this flight i would recommend indigo and would definitely fly with them again,1
IndiGo,6.0,seats narrow with not much legroom,P Henderson,2017-11-20,  bagdogra to delhi checkin slightly chaotic at ixb flight full to the last seat service on board consisted of one cup of water seats narrow with not much legroom which guaranteed very close contact to the neighbors arrival in del on time but we had to wait for some 40 min for the checked baggage to appear we had flown the same route with jet airways before who provided a much better experience than indigo,0
IndiGo,1.0,an extremely annoying experience,F Burton,2017-11-20,  we were traveling back from hyderabad to bangalore with our 85 year old mother and young children the flight was delayed by 90 minutes in total and instead of arriving at 1030pm we arrived at 1205am we had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate we were advised to go back and sit as the passengers were coming through the passage we couldnt make our way back to the seats the air hostesses were extremely rude repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats they were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone they asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious in summary an extremely annoying experience air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude intolerant and unwilling to listen,0
IndiGo,9.0,would definitely recommend,Anjay Krishnamurthy,2017-11-20, the service has been consistently good easily the best airline for domestic travel within india in my experience they have been on time every single time 6  7 times a year that i flew extra legroom seats are charged nominally no business class decent choice of snacks and beverages no alcohol crew are very professional and friendly the aircraft could do with some inflight entertainment though would definitely recommend this airline to anyone visiting india or flying out,1
IndiGo,3.0,late night flights late,Rucha Save,2017-08-12,  bangalore to mumbai indigos late night flights are always late this is my third experience with same flight  flight is delayed by 1hr 10mins last time when i travelled a month before then it was delayed by 2 hours this is really horrible generally this flight is taken by one who attends office whole day and then come for flight and you face this issue again and again indigo will lose its reputation if they continue to do so,0
IndiGo,9.0,amazes me with their service,Bhargav Dodla,2017-08-12, indigo always amazes me with their service the environment in the aircraft from chennai to mumbai is very well maintained and the crew takes care of the passengers so very well it is definitely the best airline in india i would always be happy to fly with indigo airlines,1
IndiGo,3.0,no through checkin,S Hashavi,2017-08-12,  new delhi to muscat via mumbai was an horrific experience  i booked delhimuscat ticket on indigo website they had a flight via mumbai where flight was to be changed the ticket was under single pnr i confirmed with customer care if the luggage will be through checked in  he confirmed it would be done but at the time of check in the officer denied  started asking me the name of person who confirmed now who remembers the name of customer care executive so i had to take the luggage in mumbai  checkin again with no other option i did take the luggage the gap between the 2 flight was of about 3 hours i was supposed to be transferred to international airport when i asked the ground staff to arrange transfer they were clueless  asked me to go out hire a taxi  leave i got upset but instead of helping me the mumbai ground staff kept on arguing the taxi took a good time to reach international airport as it was peak hour finally we could make it just in time only to find that the flight was delayed this is the first time i have seen that international flight booked under one pnr from an airline website no through checkin no transferswhen both the flights are from same airline basic flight no service no entertainment expensive food,0
IndiGo,9.0,no arrival cards onboard,H Advani,2017-08-12,  bangkok to pune via kolkata as  faultless flight except for a longstanding problem no arrival cards onboard the flight for foreign nationals thus delaying on arrival in calcutta the immigration process repeated requests over these past many years have yielded no positive result,1
IndiGo,1.0,delayed by 230 hours,Nikhil Shah,2017-08-12, the flight from delhi to ahmedabad was delayed by 230 hours in the night scheduled departure was at 1040 pm and actual departure is 1250 pm this was my second worst experience within a fortnight period with indigo they just give the reason of technical glitch and no alternate arrangements are there,0
IndiGo,9.0,best domestic airline in india,Sounak Moulik,2017-08-12,  kolkata to hyderabad it is the best domestic airline in india with best prices and the most punctual one it is seldom late so i have never been in problem due to late arrivals as i mostly travel in late night flights food is basically paid one but i have never tried anytime they consist of mainly ready to eat meals like cupnoodles biriyani sandwiches,1
IndiGo,9.0,it was a comfortable flight,Khalid Nadeem,2017-08-12,  delhi to varanasi this was my first flight with indigo and i was accompanied with my sister and her three children 2 kids and 1 infant at checkin we were given priority due to family i was informed that they wont be able to accommodate us in one row as the seats were full on my request the lady at the counter talked to her supervisor and allotted us seats in the first row which are paid seats without any extra fee that was really surprising and too generous of them the boarding was smooth the aircraft was clean and the food paid was good it was a comfortable flight with very attentive and hospitable cabin crew even the ground staff was very helpful and courteous the flight was on time and luggage reclaim was almost smooth indigo definitely lived upto its tagline of ontime budget airline would definitely love to fly it again,1
IndiGo,5.0,the flight crew were good,H Reddy,2017-08-12,  flew indigo from bhubaneswar to chennai travel was good the flight crew were good too the flight was on time however there a strange high pitched sound just before take off which lasted for 510 minutes and the ac stopped working until the flight took off the sound was again heard during landing too the baggage at conveyer belt after the flight landed was messed up on the same belt there was back to back baggage for 3 flights which was cumbersome and troublesome i had to stand at the belt for an hour waiting to receive my luggage it was very crowded with people looking for bags ground service was poor,0
IndiGo,4.0,comfort might be a difficulty,V Andrews,2017-08-12,  delhi to mumbai on indigo airbus a321 had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online we went to the airport directly however it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks this issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline the flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure the seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame then comfort might be a difficulty as this is a low cost carrier meals and snacks such as sandwiches both veg and nonvegetarian teacoffee and cup noodles were offered as i had booked this flight with a corporate meal a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff the sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can after the snack unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result it got even more cramped to be fair to the crew they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers the positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency on the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem their inflight magazine hello 6e had some articles but was by and large an inshop magazine would i fly with them again maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead,0
IndiGo,8.0,departure and arrival was on time,G Johar,2017-08-12,"

IndiGo,2.0,they divide our family,Udit Thakar,2017-02-17,  rachi to vadodara via delhi one day prior to my flight indigo changed my flight time and worst part they divided our family of four into 3 and 1 three of us has one flight and time and single member has another flight with a different time for the same destination on the same day and when i was travelling many seats were vacant why they didnt know,0
IndiGo,9.0,good ontime airline,Pratik Bavlecha,2017-02-17, indigo is my preferred airline on the dubai to mumbai route  especially when not carrying checked in baggage good ontime airline and good flight timings courteous and mostly well trained staff  no inflight entertainment food and drinks paid as its a budget airline,1
IndiGo,1.0,handling of baggage was horrible,K Khanna,2017-02-17, hyderabad to chennai i had the worst experience flying with indigo airlines the flight was delayed by 2 hours and adding to that handling of baggage was horrible baggage of 6 flights was released on a single belt at the same time it took almost 1 hour to find the baggage and to find the baggage i had to make my way through 1000s of passengers waiting for their baggage when contacted customer service they didnt have the contact info of indigo go personal in the airport,0
IndiGo,8.0,on time and comfortable,A Amir,2017-02-17, delhi to hyderabad with indigo my flight was cancelled and i was moved to another flight apart from this everything was good apart from the cost of the meals i didnt find the coffee and noodles too special and werent great new flight was on time and comfortable not much to talk about but was good as far as the budget airline tag goes,1

IndiGo,9.0,did not have thai immigration forms,H Advani,2017-02-17,yet another comfortable friendly and smooth indigo flight flying from pune to bangkok via kolkata a caveat in a hundred international flights into bangkok in the past two decades for the first time ever in my experience an airline indigo did not have thai immigration forms anybody who has been through immigration at suvarnbhumi expects a wait of up to one hour so to not have immigration forms on board a flight can develop into an even longer wait come on indigo otherwise as usual a flawless indigo flight,1
IndiGo,9.0,a loyal traveller with indigo,Himanshu Chauhan,2017-02-17,  delhi to port blair via kolkata indigo used to be my best option because of its on time schedule but due to a few problems and  delays i chose other options like vistara on 12th november 2016 i again chose indigo for a family holiday in port blair from delhi i was very happy and satisfied with all the services even the flight was ahead of its schedule and the cabin crew was warm and the hospitality was just amazing im again a loyal traveller with indigo now,1
IndiGo,8.0,inflight service impeccable,H Advani,2016-11-17,another flawless flight flew bangkok to pune via kolkata with indigo on time both departures and both arrivals smooth boarding from bangkok impeccable onboard service und attitude chaotic boarding at kolkata a long queue formed at boarding fine then an announcement was made by a ground staff member in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 1630 would board first since the announcement was barely audible people waiting in the queue were confused thus standing in line not knowing what to do ground crew member  only one indigo staff manning their preboarding deskarea  did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board people waiting in the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person spoke to him and were allowed to board no idea if these people were going to occupy rows 1630 nothing happening line not moving indigo staff still looking as if he was in a daze no repeat announcement in an audible voice re rows 1630 since i was in line had a seat in row 21 i broke the queue presented my boarding pass and passed security dont know what happened after that indigo needs to get its act together in this area inflight service again impeccable,1
IndiGo,5.0,staff truly inexperienced,Sunil Mahato,2016-11-17,bangalore to nagpur with indigo on this trip to india i was fortunate enough to try 3 different airlines  air india jet airways and indigo indigo definitely scored best in terms of its modern fleet however not recommended for international passengers due to its baggage restrictions the fares arent that cheap compared to other airlines however air india allows the most baggage weight the staff are young and attractive but truly inexperienced to handle situations personally didnt have a choice since indigo had so many direct flights to remote cities,1
IndiGo,5.0,disappointing and sad experience,P Richards,2016-11-17, indigo mumbai to delhi return the outward journey started with a smooth and easy check in at mumbai flight on time the aircraft was clean and as per indigo standards what was very poor on this flight was the crew the leading stewardess in particular seemed to sit and do not much while the other crew worked shame to see indigo crew standards falling it was also a morning flight but they had none of the breakfast options available  ramen noodles were my best option return flight had a great crew but the delhi airport check in was a nightmare long lines people cutting lines no indigo crew to help quite a disappointing and sad experience the days of looking for indigo flights to book may be over,0
IndiGo,6.0,personal favourite for short flights,Mehul Choudhury,2016-11-17,ranchi to kolkata with indigo i travel frequently with this airline and trust me folks this is the best you can get in terms of value for money compared to other airlines in india indigo has been my personal favourite for short flights the flight crew is fairly good im 61 and i find the seat compact but this is the same for all lccs and not ideal on long flights cabin staff appearance is smart they are courteous but not always consistent there is no inflight entertainment on these flights short flights they are perfect medium duration okay long flights not recommended,1
IndiGo,9.0,staff was nice and helpful,A Greenberg,2016-11-17,  great airline i had 3 domestic flights with indigo udaipurmumbai mumbaigoa and goadelhi booking in its website was easy and prices were competetive checkin at the airports was easy and fast  indigo had many counters open in all 3 airports flights departured with no delays of more than 5 minutes the airplanes looked new and very clean staff was nice and helpful on two occasions i ordered a sandwich about 250 rupees which was quiet tasty to my surprise the only downside that i can think of is that the seats are not very comfortable but its a low cost airline and flights usually last only 12 hours so its not such a big deal highly recommended,1

IndiGo,9.0,flight experience always been good,Avi Singh,2016-07-30,pune to lucknow via new delhi i have flown every low cost airline in india and i find indigo the best their booking is hassle free through app on both ios and android web checkin is a breeze getting any optional services is also good the checkin is curteous and to the point mind you they dont allow even 1kg extra on planes without payment plus they have also started to screen weight of cabin bag just before boarding the flight its a business model because they are a budget airline the planes are clean with courteous crew the leg space of economy seats is ample i am a heavy built person and i have never faced space crunch in the seats the inflight food is okay nothing to write about i never had to wait for my baggage for more than 10 min overall the flight experience has always been good,1

IndiGo,5.0,ambience was pleasant,Chandan Kodgirwar,2016-07-30,overall experience with indigo flight from delhi to pune is good compared to others which i have travelled cabin space and seating arrangement is better than others overall ambience was pleasant i think indigo could enhance their service by adding some information devices inside the cabin showing a route map and if possible some outside coverage such as cameras they could also offer indian food during meal times rather than junk food,1
IndiGo,10.0,a flawless flight,H Advani,2016-07-30,sometimes i seem to be repeating myself  travel from bangkok to pune via kolkata 34 times yearly  but once again a flawless flight from indigo something i have written about in the past the fact that the on board crew never has any arrival forms for foreigners was finally rectified but however with an amusing twist on my asking the cabin attendant for an arrival form something that only nonindian nationals need to fill she very pertly asked me as to why i needed one since i look indian i replied that i was only 9999 indian the remaining 01 being american as i carry that countrys passport i did not mention that the indian diaspora is the largest in the world i was however tempted to do so ps food and beverages have to be purchased on indigo i never comment on these as i usually carry aboard lots of munchiessnackies,1
IndiGo,8.0,welltrained and helpful,Dhruv Bhatt,2016-07-30,mumbai to jaipur i am a frequent flyer on this particular route i prefer a lowcost flight on this route as the journey time is just 2 hrs indigo is not a fullservice carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an indigo flight be sure that you reach on time they have a record of on time departures the ground crew and cabin crew is welltrained and swift and helpful the only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system the magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in india for a vacation or a tour the airline connects almost each and every airport of india also they are flying to some international destinations like dubai they also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good the meals served are ready to cook meals and some snacks also available with good range of beverages,1
IndiGo,2.0,yet another bad experience,Gunjan Singh,2016-01-26,yet another bad experience with indigo from udaipur to mumbai we arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure we were told that seats were all web checked in so we were forced to take paid seats or sit in different rows concept of unregulated extra charges within economy class is wrong moreover these are not declared at the time of booking tickets,0
IndiGo,8.0,punctual and comfortable,Ravi Mene,2016-01-26,pune to nagpur with indigo the plane was new check in was smooth boarding systematic they are the only airline who use walkway to board the aircraft this is better than using steps as pnq airport does not use its airbridges for every flight fa were smartly turned out and professional the onboard trolley had snacks and beverages for purchase the flights were punctual and comfortable,1
IndiGo,10.0,was very impressed,Thomas Zasso,2016-01-26,delhi to goa and i flew three times with indigo the planes are new and clean and staff very professional seats are large and comfortable the pilots communicate well with the passengers flights were on time they have shuttle buses which bring you to the plane checkin was fast and smooth and you can bring along 2 checkin bags with no extra charge i was very impressed as i was not sure what to expect,1
IndiGo,3.0,i missed my flight,Zavier Murtza,2016-01-26,bangalore to pune a lack of organisational and communication skills and ticket counter staff had no idea how to handle awkward customers i arrived at the airport with enough time to check in the counter staff was dealing with a customer who missed her flight and this lasted over 15 minutes and meant that even though i was fast tracked to the front of queue i missed my flight  despite the flight not departing for another 40 minutes i was told that i had to rebook a fresh flight at the cost of 17500inr which was then reduced to 3600inr after i complained and explained the situation,0
IndiGo,10.0,would fly them again,M Sekhri,2016-01-26,flew delhi to mumbai and the first time i tried indigo via my travel broker i have flown spicejet and jet airways and didnt really enjoy my experience with them so i was keen to try another option pleasantly surprised on all fronts customer service flights were ontime and the inflight food was good seats were good sized as well not as crammed as spicejet i would fly them again,1
IndiGo,6.0,all flights on time,Prayash Giria,2016-01-26,flew various domestic flights with indigo through last year all flights on time never more than a ten minute delay and they have a fairly comprehensive network  food was poor choices often not available prices are no longer cheap staff is competent but not that courteous they use bus boarding even at terminals where airbridges are empty which is irritating,1
IndiGo,5.0,long admired indigo,S Shetty,2016-01-26,bombay to ahmedabad return i have long admired indigo for its focus on providing ontime service at a decent price with seats which are reasonably comfortable i never minded paying the fee for better seats in the first row or exit row or for food which is against decent and i recommended it to many however after a gap of over a year i flew indigo again and found the seats so thin and the fares were not that decent compared to some carriers,0
IndiGo,8.0,recommend indigo,Chinar Dankhara,2016-01-26,port blair to delhi via kolkata the check in process required more time than expected the staff was average seats were quite comfortable and aisle access was fair reliable airline and never been delayed food was available on request and is not included in the flight ticket in flight entertainment was fair i would recommend indigo for budget travellers solo and family,1
IndiGo,8.0,service and aircraft up to the mark,Scherazade Irani,2016-01-26,i have flown with indigo on several occasions domestically and this was my first international flight with them seamless check in with very polite ground staff cabin crew were polite pleasant and efficient the aircraft was clean even the lavatories were kept fairly clean choice of food onboard to be purchased was decent dxbbom had a long check in queue but the process however was efficient onboard service and aircraft cleanliness was up to the mark seats are pretty comfortable as theyre slimmer hence providing a better amount of leg space departuresarrivals on time,1
IndiGo,10.0,another flawless flight,H Advani,2016-01-26,another flawless flight with indigo returned to thailand ten days ago and flew from pune to bangkok with a plane change at kolkata layover time about 2 hours smooth checkin pune and cal smooth boarding at both places and very smooth and comfy flight with the alwaysfriendly efficient and helpful cabin crew on time departure and arrival a few minutes early i like the use of a ramp in pune while getting onoff indigo planes so much easier than stepsstairs clicked na on food and bev these are available but i have never tried them,1

IndiGo,10.0,a superb experience,H Advani,2015-11-28,a superlative experience flew bangkok to pune via kolkata with indigo waited at the baggage carousel very short wait had checked in two items a bag and a long cardboard tube containing prints the former arrived at the carousel the latter did not enquired from indigo staff attending at and they informed me that since the tube was marked fragile it would arrive separately very shortly which it did and asked me if i was connecting to an indigo flight and on my answering yes i was indigo said they will assign staff member to escort me and my luggage to domestic departures a lady took charge of me and my luggage  she insisted on pushing my trolley i insisted on doing it myself i won  and took me all the way to indigo xray security as i was carrying a bottle of dutyfee liquor in my carry on and since liquor cannot be carried on domestic flights i checked my back pack through xray and the indigo staff to avoid bottle smashing tied my backpack up very securely and put a fragile tag on it and asked the staff escorting me to inform indigo check in counter where the pack was specially tagged and given to a baggage handler to carry it personally into the baggage room a superb experience,1

IndiGo,9.0,food was absolutely delicious,Anurag Dave,2015-11-28,flew indigo from bdq to ccu via del the indigo has some of the most courteous and helpful fas despite the fact that my family didnt get seats together fas helped us swap seats with other passengers fas are also very kidfriendly the meal service in indigo economy class is better than the meal service of every uscarrier on domestic routes the food was absolutely delicious during delhi transit we were asked to stay in our seats while the crew changed and cabin was cleaned for ongoing flight to kolkata we were offered additional snacks while we were waiting inside the cabin our experience on delccu segment was also excellent the only indigo process that i find to be strange is when they check your boarding pass as you disembark the aircraft,1
IndiGo,9.0,indigo does a very good job,S Shivdasani,2015-11-28,flew indigo for the 12th time three visits to india with an aircraft change in kolkata outward and inward in the space of 12 months bkkkolpunekolbkk and indigo does a very good job from start to finish from checking in to the cabin crew to smiling pilots who say byebye when leaving the plane the planes are clean the seating is fine i am 510 and slim as each flight is around 212 hours boarding is efficiently done and every departure and arrival was on time the fact that baggage takes time to arrive is probably beyond the airlines control,1
IndiGo,8.0,comfortable and very clean,Adnan Mir,2015-11-28,morning flight from singapore to chennai arrived at check in three hours early and had no checked in baggage so check in was smooth and quick boarding was also very quick and professional upon boarding i changed my seat from where i was sitting in the front to the seats just in front of the emergency seats near the wing as it was empty i believe indigo keeps these seats reserved as you can pay on board to upgrade these seats but no one bothered me for moving to these seats slept throughout the flight and overall flight was comfortable and very clean no ife or food but this was a short flight so not bothered at all about it would recommend in future,1
IndiGo,3.0,poor ground service,Rakesh Dhareshwar,2015-11-28,poor ground service they asked me to check in my hand baggage for excess weight which i understand is the rule but when i was boarding the aircraft i was amazed to find that loads of passengers had huge hand bags and in some cases multiple bags which possibly were more than the weight limit the ground staff told me that they check the weight again at the boarding gate to ensure that there is no overweight baggage but i did not see any other bag being weighed other than mine,0

IndiGo,5.0,indigo customer review,Shrivallabh Randad,2015-09-03,we have taken the flight from indore and we are regular flyers with indigo the seats were most uncomfortable there was hardly any cushioning on the seat experience of seat was more or less similar to as if we were seating on wooden bench you have already curtailed seat pitch and now the uncushioned seats you are requested to have some feeling for passengers minimum level of actual comfort also looking forward for better and more comfortable seats,1
IndiGo,8.0,indigo customer review,B Vincent,2015-09-03,i recently took several flights with indigo and didnt experience any major issues i checked other airlines before i booked and indigo were consistently cheaper often by a wide margin flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for lcc at 29 the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design  others could learn from this staff were friendly and professional throughout inflight food is purchaseonly and expensive by indian standards although they will provide free drinking water  a word of caution about preordering if you take up the 250rs prepaid option you could end up losing money depending on your choice of fooddrink also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day and some options eg jaljeera juice seem to consistently run out but these are minor quibbles i would have no hesitation choosing indigo next time,1
IndiGo,5.0,indigo customer review,Kalpesh Ashar,2015-09-03,6e 062 service has deteriorated ontime urgency once seen is no longer seen online seat booking charges for all aisle and window seats you can only get middle seats for free too money minded,0
IndiGo,3.0,indigo customer review,Roma Solomon,2015-09-03,we were supposed to board our flight from delhi to lucknow at 1215 on the 21st of may but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot also there was no step  senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily i have reported this before but it has made no difference at lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 230 pm and were again herded into a bus i was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares it was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of may for the 640 flight we were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebodys luggage because the insensitive staff did not care i will not travel on indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle,0
IndiGo,5.0,indigo customer review,P Gould,2015-09-03,went from delhi to kochi because there is no such thing as a direct delhi to male maldives flight and even with connections you have to mix and match airlines in order to get a halfway decent connection schedule the airline is like the low budget carriers in europe with people packed in like sardines they dont have an inflight magazine that actually has anything to read or even a map with their air routes,0
IndiGo,6.0,indigo customer review,Tan Ying Kuan,2015-09-03,delpnqpunedel december 2014 worst possible time of the year to fly out of delhi had horrible experiences due to the fog the outgoing flight was 4hrs late you might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs that being said i agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal complimentary snack box and teacoffee was provided on the return flight night time flight we were diverted to ahmedabad due to fog this was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt indigos reputation we were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs when we approached the assistants at ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel no food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls we were boarded onto a new flight the following day though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into,1

IndiGo,2.0,indigo customer review,Manoj Chaumal,2015-04-10,was travelling from dubai to mumbai i was fond of indigo before this trip checkin was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge however got some shopping from the duty free as far as i know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip shopping at duty free is not considered as hand baggage weight wait this is indigo you would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine and charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at duty free what more the person carries only manual slip no credit cards accepted not even usd or inr globally accepted currency  home currency had to go back to the currency counter to exchange this was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks 40 aed  kg plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty asked the cabin crew if i can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer i got was that i would have to pay extra if i want to sit they would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit very disappointed with the approach,0

IndiGo,10.0,indigo customer review,Varun Ravichandran,2014-12-01,chennai to bangalore the flight took off from chennai on time with the captain warning us beforehand that there was very heavy weather over bangalore that he would try to avoid we eventually got to bangalore airspace and ended up circling for 20 minutes or more until the captain announced that the thunderstorm had passed and we could land before our fuel situation worsened reasonably comfortable seat and friendly crew possibly the most efficient lcc in the indian skies at the moment and wouldnt hesitate to fly them again,1
IndiGo,1.0,indigo customer review,Sriharsha Narasimhan,2014-12-01,flight 6e 473 from mumbai to bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 2202 hrs due to weather conditions enroute to bangalore however it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage  first bag was delivered at 2242 hrs bangalore airport is very efficient and i have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years  both domestic and international flights this delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad coordination amongst the ground staff today indigo airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive  they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes no supervisory staff were available to address the issue rain had stopped when this flight landed since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight  walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus none of us were wet  but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute indigo flight 6e 412 from kochi to bangalore landed at 2206 hrs even this flight was late but the last bag for this indigo flight was on belt at 2224 hrs if the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the mumbaibangalore flight how can they blame the weather system i dont see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad coordination for this delay,0

IndiGo,8.0,indigo customer review,S Srinivasan,2014-01-13,maadel its been a few years since ive flown indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good  easy checkin procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally ontime clean planes and all for a good price i decided to try the fast forward service which provides priority checkin and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person while the services were delivered as promised i found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular checkin line was very short and baggage delivery in del is fast even without the priority tags the seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep i dont think id want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight,1

IndiGo,10.0,indigo customer review,U V Naresh,2013-05-23,i was supposed to fly from delhi to mumbai this morning 1025am on indigo but delhi airport was heavily fogged out and the runway operations had been shut for a few hours i was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal upon arrival i was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and indigo were unsure when departures would take place they immediately asked me if i would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening i declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties the whole affair was so well handled i was most impressed by indigos ground staff this is one rare gem in the indian aviation scene,1

SpiceJet,1.0,policy seems unfair and exploitative,Sonu Dhami,2024-09-23,i recently had the misfortune of flying with spicejet and it was one of the worst experiences ive ever had with an airline  the crew was unprofessional unhelpful and lacked basic courtesy lack of information regarding flight delays boarding and other essential updates no assistance provided for damaged seats or basic amenities charged ₹2400 for being 1 minute late for boarding despite a long queue this policy seems unfair and exploitative seats were damaged and uncomfortable long queues and inefficient boarding process  overall a poorly managed and chaotic experience  avoid flying with spicejet unless absolutely necessary,0

SpiceJet,1.0,only sends automated emails,Sachin Atri,2024-09-23,spicejet justifies the tag of being a budget airline so much so that it does not believe in giving boarding passes online either a customer could keep doing web check in without receiving the boarding pass or an email confirming the same the customer service only sends automated emails whoever you email to the response is an immediate auto response email and the icing on the cake is that their flights a day before get delayed and the reason cited is operatonal and one could keep guessing what that possibly means and this experience is even before a customer has taken the flight,0
SpiceJet,10.0,outstanding service i experienced,Sanket Shah,2024-09-23,i wanted to take a moment to express my sincere thanks for the outstanding service i experienced on my recent flight from pune to delhi sg8937 from the moment i boarded the warmth and friendliness of the air hostesses and crew stood out they were incredibly attentive always ensuring that every passenger was comfortable and well taken care of the professionalism and care they demonstrated from the safety briefings to the inflight service were truly commendable the team went above and beyond to create a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere making the journey not just a flight but a delightful experience,1

SpiceJet,1.0,worst ever domestic airline,Kamal Dhama,2024-09-23,worst ever domestic airline in india currently their flights are always delayed for 34 hours and their support staff always comes with strange and poor reasons they don’t care about their passengers they make them wait for long hours without providing them the actual timings they don’t even compensate for their delays they offer a refund if a flight is delayed by 3 hours which is useless anyways because you have to book another flight for you on the spot which costs you double the amount and you are already late their support staff is not even bothered to help and guide their passengers inside the flight you won’t even get a 250ml water bottle if you request then only you will be given half of glass water only,0
SpiceJet,1.0,worst ever experience ,Preeti Bhargava,2024-09-23,worst ever experience always delayed also the ground staff till the cabin crew no one has the basic sense of womens comfort and safety  even after observing and requested they made me sit between two men  such bad experience not once this is always,0

SpiceJet,1.0,not recommend this airline ,Sanath Kumar,2024-06-22,the flight got delayed indefinitely and the airline people didn’t even bother to announce the delay and no refreshment was provided to the elders and children leave alone adults while asked they gave a senseless response and this is because the flight is the only available carrier in that particular route though i did not raise this issue immediately and i was a spicemax customer this is silly and unpardonable  i would not recommend this airline to any of my friends,0
SpiceJet,1.0,ask you to weigh you handbag,Aaditya Gupta,2024-06-22,the absolute worst airline the luggage is handled in a way that you might start to pity what you are carrying amazingly they will ask you to weigh you handbag and if you happen to carry a laptop along with a few other electronic devices they will say anything to charge you extra opt for this airline only if you have no other option,0

SpiceJet,1.0,demanding extra money,Praveen Gupta,2024-06-22,on each airline cabin bag is allowed up to 7kg apart from laptop bag but spicejet has started weighing at the time of boarding both laptop and cabin bag together and demanding extra money rs 600kg if you communicate that you haven’t checked in any bag then they also do not listen they are also not allowing you to shift the bag to check in baggage by saying that time is over happened on pune to delhi flight on 2nd jun and from some passengers they extra charge rs 3000 never book any flight from spicejet,0

SpiceJet,1.0,they refused to take responsibility,S Chatterjee,2024-03-11,spicejet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience traveling with my family a total of six individuals we embarked on a journey from amritsar atq india to dxb dubai on february 24 2024 the scheduled departure time was 0840 am with a connecting flight from dubai to london heathrow at 1430 hrs via emirates our ticket was booked through the bookingcom portal as a single ticket rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection however our experience with spicejet quickly turned sour departing from atq the flight was delayed by 55 minutes upon arrival in dubai we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation initially we were given excuses regarding weather conditions despite the clear and sunny day in dubai and optimal weather conditions for takeoff eventually a member of the ground staff revealed the truth  the delay was due to spicejets scheduling issues and the busy nature of dubai airport this delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to london heathrow expecting assistance from spicejet we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution however to our dismay they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions their staff was unhelpful and dismissive leaving us stranded in dubai with our children consequently we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the uk i feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airlines deceptive practices spicejets lack of accountability and disregard for customer welfare make them a company to avoid at all costs,0

SpiceJet,1.0,do not book spicejet flights,APURVA Sanghvi,2024-01-25,nightmare experience with a toddler we booked a direct flight from mumbai to jaisalmer with spicejet in june for the xmas holidays come a week before the flight spicejet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in delhi and 10 hour layover options at such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund we wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover this was denied too they held on to our money for 6 months before doing this this is not where the ordeal ends the first flight was delayed sat on the runway for over an hour before take off we had to rush and change terminals we were assured that our suitcases would reach jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff they did not we were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day we were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family we asked them to reimburse this amount too they did not we asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu they did not have it do not book spicejet flights even if you’re getting them for free take this as a warning before you spoil you entire vacation you have been planning and looking forward to for months,0
SpiceJet,1.0,a disheartening experience,Abhinav Agarwal,2024-01-25,i recently had a disheartening experience with spicejet my flight on november 28 was delayed by a staggering 6 hours prompting me to book an alternative with another airline the real frustration began when i sought a refund for the delayed flight despite daily calls to their customer service there has been zero progress the only consistent thing ive received from spicejet is false promises that i will get the revert on mail within 6 hours its been a month and im still waiting for a revert mail this lack of responsiveness and accountability is unacceptable i expected better service especially in handling situations involving significant delays if you value your time and money think twice before choosing spicejet my experience has been nothing short of disappointing,0
SpiceJet,2.0,left us deeply dissatisfied,Asha Kumar,2024-01-25,we had prebooked flight tickets from delhi to hyderabad expecting a 7 am departure unfortunately the flight experienced multiple delays first pushed to 8 am then further delayed to 1050 am 11 am and finally 1215 pm these continuous delays were quite challenging for us significantly disrupting our schedule the airlines inefficiency led to a waste of our precious time when we requested lounge access due to the prolonged delay the airline offered a meal instead there were murmurs among passengers about spicejets limited staffing and flights suggesting that they might be playing games with travelers overall the lack of support and the series of delays left us deeply dissatisfied based on this experience i strongly advise against booking a flight with spicejet even if they offer enticing deals,0
SpiceJet,1.0,never travel through spicejet,A Ashmi,2024-01-25,terrible experience flight had been delayed for almost 6 hours we are travelling through spicejet airlines and currently stuck at jaipur airport for almost 3 hours  according to them it is just because of fog we also missed our second flight due to this never travel through spicejet,0

SpiceJet,1.0,keep delaying the flights often,Manashwini Gurumurthy,2024-01-25,the flight was supposed to be departed at 1055am from chennai it is currently 1258pm and the boarding has not even commenced the flight has been delayed without any proper communication for more than 4 times and it seems this is not the first time this spicejet route is delayed if they know that there is a discrepancy n regulatory requirement for flights to have an onehour maintenance after an international trip the spicejet team should have an alternate carrier or avoid this route they keep delaying the flights often,0
SpiceJet,2.0,not up to par with standards,T Hamson,2024-01-25,spicejet services are not up to par with standards heavily delayed flight schedule flight delayed for more than 4 hours the delay impacts a lot wheelchair assistance was ordered but the very impolite ground staff in kolkata airport the ground staff showed tempers in front of customers cabin crew has a professional attitude but have a restricted leg space,0

SpiceJet,1.0,staff is rude and arrogant,R Prasanna,2023-12-07,its better to not fly if this is the last option for you to fly the flight is delayed is no reason the time of delay is never communicated the duration of delay can ever extend and the biggest issue is that they wont ever approach or be available to address the concerns of the passengers the response to why the delay happened will be so technical that you will wish to not have asked for it the staff is rude and arrogant in short avoid this at all costs unless you have nothing to do on the day you wish to fly and are okay to spend time walking around the airport or spend time shopping at the airport,0
SpiceJet,10.0,i enjoyed my journey,S Marhan,2023-12-07,it was a brilliant experience with this airline i have flew many time with other airline but i enjoyed my journey with this airline and the staff behavior of the staff is very polite and sweet,1

SpiceJet,1.0,worst experience i ever had,Shamit Bhasin,2023-11-01,the worst experience i ever had the flight was delayed by 30 mins first then delayed again but we were not even informed about that and just stalled for an hour more after that on arrival we were informed that even our luggage hasnt been transported and will be delivered the next day 5am in the morning we were asked to fill forms for the same the level of unprofessionalism is just too much the best advice i can give to any fellow traveller is spend a bit more but dont prefer this airline,0
SpiceJet,1.0,no compensation or apology offered,R Shakar,2023-11-01,the management of flights and addressing customer care issues is extremely unprofessional flight from bagdogra got delayed by 3 hours no compensation or apology offered the flight from kolkata to port blair got cancelled and the only thing i received was an automated message saying its cancelled the link given in the same message showed me no flights available customer care executive picked up after calling for the 10th time and waiting for almost 20 mins on the line the resolution offered she said dont get on the bagdogra flight contact staff at the airport wouldnt have called if that had helped extremely unprofessional in sticking to the planned take off time and my complaints were treated like a bother and received half hearted efforts from staff at every level even now as im waiting at kolkata airport it seems likely that there will be delays and more inconvenience,0
SpiceJet,7.0,a pretty good flight,V Gupta,2023-11-01,on my return to mumbai from kolkata the airline autoassigned me a random seat as i had selected that option during the web checkin the baggage drop process at ccu airport was smooth and boarding also started on time this time i was pleased to notice that the crew members were actually greeting all the passengers which was much better compared to the last time i had flown them departure was smooth and as this was an overnight flight the cabin lights were dimmed for most of the flight descent and landing were on time followed by a swift luggage retrieval overall for the price that was paid this was a pretty good flight the airline has been undergoing a lot of difficulties in recent times but if it can keep up this level of work it will be good,1
SpiceJet,9.0,it was the happiest trip,Mukesh Venugopal,2023-11-01,we are very happy to be with the crews ms shanti and shemin at the board of sg 17 it was our flight on spicejet with manav 8 months old our son they are very nicely taken care of our son on board and provided all the assistance whenever needed it was the happiest trip we had travelled in a while thankyou so much for shanti shemin and all other members who assisted us have great future ahead,1
SpiceJet,2.0,they enforce a strict 7 kg limit,R Thamashil,2023-11-01,on 25 september 2023 i had the misfortune of flying with spicejet on flight sg 17 from dubai to cochin spicejet has  a weighing machine at the entrance to check the weight of each passengers hand luggage and they enforce a strict 7 kg limit if you exceed this limit you are charged a70 aed per kg this situation is unacceptable and amounts to nothing less than exploitation of passengers who choose spicejet for budgetfriendly fares to add to the disappointment the condition of the aircraft itself was far from satisfactory the seats looked worn out and the cabin appearance was lackluster i urge fellow travelers to exercise caution when considering spicejet for your flights,0
SpiceJet,10.0,excellent service,Ramanathan Ramchandra,2023-11-01,excellent service by the ground staff courteous beyond expectations always willing to help in the real sense and not lipservice i will recommend to all whom i know,1
SpiceJet,5.0,a decent functional experience,S Harshun,2023-11-01,i had taken this evening flight to calcutta during the web checkin i had opted for the random seat selection for which there would be no charges applied as i was travelling solo so before 12 hours of the departure i had received the seat checkin was done at the old t1 terminal at bom where baggage drop was done swiftly as there was no line and queues which was surprising the boarding started on time however i noticed that when i was about to greet the crew there were 2 crew members who were not really greeting any of the passengers and seem surprised that i wished them good evening when they reciprocated ideally greeting the passengers is something that should be standard also i noticed that the load on this flight was on the lighter side as well however due to the atc clearances the actual pushback and departure was delayed by over 1 hour but this was not on the airline the pilots did a good job of keeping the passengers updated about the reasons for the delay the flight itself was operated on one of those boeing 737800ng aircraft that was painted in the erstwhile jetconnect liveries the pilots tried to make the time en route on the flight and was able to retrieve my luggage soon without waiting too long while spicejet has been going through a lot of difficulties in recent times and that was also reflected in the manner in which the crew seemed disinterested in greeting the passengers there are still small things that the airline can do which can still make a small difference to the passenger experience because otherwise for the fare that was paid this was a decent functional experience that was able to get me safely to my destination,1
SpiceJet,2.0,not a good experience,Guddu Kumar,2023-11-01,i booked the ticket from cleartrip app and i select window seat but during boarding pass they change my seat from window to middle i paid 300 for that seat there no support from spicejet team not a good experience seat is not good,0
SpiceJet,1.0,i was denied boarding,Rohit Chaturvedi,2023-11-01,i recently booked a ticket from chennai to delhi on 6th september 2023 but sadly i had to encounter the worst experience with spicejet where i was denied boarding on a mere request of writing only 2 words on the excess baggage receipt  laptop bag after payment of the excess baggage charges for the laptop bag that i was carrying such conduct from spicejet was very unprofessional and dissatisfactory when a customer pays the ticket price he owns the right to travel through the flight and taking away this right is illegal in all terms i cannot understand if there is a policy of spicejet to charge amounts for a laptop bag what made the team cancel my onboarding on the request of adding these 2 words  laptop bag on the excess baggage charge payment receipt to my utmost surprise when i raised this with spicejet they are saying that i have only refused to travel and they did not deny onboarding this is completely false as any sensible person can vouch for it  if i would have to refuse travel i would not have even paid the excess baggage charges in the first instance this is a pure betrayal from spicejet at least they should have the guts to accept what they did they have even refused to refund the ticket price,0
SpiceJet,1.0,a very bad experience,Mahek Sharma,2023-09-21,a very bad experience the boarding was early but the take off the landing everything else was late even though we paid extra for leg space we did not get any leg space our money was waste i also attached a photo showing how less out leg space was even though we paid extra money for it we were supposed to land at 720 but we landed at 8 the luggage did not arrive till 9 even though the landing was at 8 we had to wait an hour for the luggage and the manager who was standing there also had 0 communication of where our luggage was indigo the flight which arrived later than spicejet also received their luggage on the same belt before us a very bad experience one can say never flying in spicejet ever again,0

SpiceJet,1.0,disheartening experience,T Raj,2023-09-21,disheartening experience  unprofessional staff and unreasonable charges my recent journey with spicejet from calicut to dubai was a complete disappointment the checkin process was marred by unprofessional behavior from the staff we encountered an unfortunate experience with the staff who displayed aggression and utter disrespect towards passengers adding to the distress the staff demanded an exorbitant additional charge for our luggage including an unreasonable claim for my babys stroller which we had previously taken on the same route without any problems during our outbound flight this inconsistency and unjustified charge left us deeply dissatisfied despite providing proof of double payment spicejet is yet to refund the excessive amount they charged us under duress it is disheartening to see an airline of this stature failing to provide basic customer satisfaction i sincerely hope spice jet takes immediate action and thoroughly trains their staff to treat passengers with respect and empathy as loyal customers we expect a better travel experience and fair treatment this incident has left me questioning whether i should ever consider flying with spicejet again,0
SpiceJet,9.0,i am satisfied and contented,Lengoumang Haokip,2023-09-21,being bit unwell the cabin crew took personal care of my condition they offered me foods and drinks to help me remain stable throughout the journey the crew gave high level of service and attention i am satisfied and contented,1
SpiceJet,1.0,no respect for passengers time,Feryal Banday,2023-09-21,if you are boarding a flight by spicejet just know that they will delay by five hours my flight without blink of eye was shifted from 430 to 8 and will there be another postponement who knows the last time i travelled by spicejet in oct 2022 from calcutta to delhi the flight which was supposed to leave at 945pm left in the morning they kept delaying all night this flight was sg8252 this is by far the worst airline i have ever been on and the experience is bad every single time no respect for the passengers time at all horrifying,0

SpiceJet,1.0,our flight was delayed 3 times,R Lohana,2023-09-21,our flight was delayed 3 times from 6 it became 714 then 810 and then 855 and even when the flight was delayed for the 3rd time they werent sure if theyre going to delay it again or not they said it was because of a ‘technical difficulty’ but all the flights had been delayed so it definitely wasnt that we demanded for free food but even that wasnt provided we finally boarded the plane at 830 after arguing a lot this was my first and last experience with them,0
SpiceJet,2.0,they kept delaying the departure,N Dantu,2023-07-11,they kept delaying the departure 1 hour and again another hour and again another hour after almost 25 hours and making passenger sit in flight they say their is technical glitch,0

SpiceJet,1.0,horrible flight services,Umaimah Shamsi,2023-03-25,horrible flight services the flight was initially at 730 pm it being an international flight everyone was here by 4pm to avoid the any discrepancies only to the find out the flight has been delayed to 830 and slowly to 940 then 1040 then 1110 with that the gate number changed for 44 to 76 travelling with aged people it is so difficult to change gates when given a certain time for a flight going abroad the airline is supposed to take care on everything the passengers have planned other than a bit of food compensation the spicejet staff has not been helpful what do ever they aren’t even admitting their mistake and saying the flight is delayed they are telling all the passengers that the system is wrong we have the right information this is horrible service by the airline and they should really improve on following schedules,0
SpiceJet,1.0,flight time was changed 3 times,P Serhim,2023-03-25,flight time was changed 3 times and the last change was announced the night before our early morning flight from rajkot to delhi originally leaving rajkot at 825am changed to 930am then at the airport was delayed 2 hours because of this change we missed our connecting flight from delhi to dharamshala the staff at the airport just shrug zero sympathy they told us the next flight we can get on from delhi to dharamshala is 2 days later while waiting for the next flight no refund if we decided not to take the delhi to dharamshala flight nightmare,0
SpiceJet,1.0,i havent come across a worse service,Ekta Gupta,2023-03-25,i havent come across a worse service than the one offered by spicejet spicejet really needs to start managing its checkin counters better the staff at the airport just shrugged showing zero sympathy i entered the terminal 2 airport 1 hour 45 minutes prior but the checkin counter was closed i didnt even get to board my flight and there was no information shared with me at all about online checkin besides all the promo mail there wasnt any mail about online checkin instead they let me all the way through to the gate and told me on the last moment that i was supposed to checkin and the website was also not clear in that i checked the checkin counter was closed and they didnt do anything for me other than tell me that i should have known somehow also the flight was delayed for no reason the flight departure time was 720 pm but it was delayed by 26 minutes no partial refund no later flight instead nothing only telling me that i should have known somehow what the procedure is and pointing to the terms and conditions part on my eticket which by the way says nothing about checking in be aware of this no spicejet for me anymore,0
SpiceJet,5.0,the service was what was expected,Ashish Varun,2023-03-25,i had booked this flight a month before flying as it came at a very cheap and reasonable rate the web check in for the flight was fine and i had opted for the auto seat selection without getting charged a fare for seat selection so the boarding pass was given to me 12 hours before departure the check in and baggage drop was smooth the boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route noted that i was flying on a 737 max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated also the plane was much quieter however when boarding most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary the safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin it felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment it is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named spicescreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge it had a decent selection of movies  podcasts  magazines which was much appreciated the flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately on the whole for the cheap fare that was paid the service was what was expected and its true that even though the airline is going through challenges there are definitely aspects that should be taken care of,1
SpiceJet,1.0,flight time was changed 3 times,T Portah,2023-03-25,flight time was changed 3 times and the last change was announced the night before our early morning flight from jaipur to dharamshala via delhi originally leaving jaipur at 625am changed to 930am then at the airport was delayed 2 hours because of this change we missed our connecting flight from delhi to dharamshala the staff at the airport just shrug zero sympathy they told us the next flight we can get on from delhi to dharamshala is 2 days later and we have to book our own airport hotel to stay 2 nights in delhi while waiting for the next flight no refund if we decided not to take the delhi to dharamshala flight nightmare,0
SpiceJet,3.0,it was the worst check in,B Hasir,2023-03-25,spicejet really needs to start managing its check in counters better no person available to guide passengers to empty counters people moving from one counter to the other haphazardly in order to checkin faster it was the worst check in have experienced please please please dont make already exhausted people so angry that they snap at the staff on duty the airline has value for money but does it mean we need to ignore all the other stupid mistakes that they make,1

SpiceJet,1.0,there was a lack of clear communication,Shibin Thazhissery,2023-01-08,i recently had a bad experience flying with spicejet due to significant delays and poor communication from the staff my flight was initially delayed by several hours due to a mechanical issue and the staff did a poor job of keeping passengers informed about the situation there was a lack of clear communication about the cause of the delay and what steps were being taken to resolve the issue furthermore when the flight finally did depart it was further delayed due to additional issues with the plane the staff did not seem particularly concerned about the impact of the delays on passengers and were unapologetic about the situation overall my experience with spicejet airlines was very disappointing and i would not recommend flying with them in the future,0
SpiceJet,1.0,it seems that spicejet has a new business model,C Jansen,2023-01-08,it seems that spicejet has a new business model selling people a cheap flight annulate it and keep the money twice i had an annulated flight and the right to get my money back the first flight it took me almost two months to get my money back and for this flight its impossible to reach them choose indigo we had several flights with this company strictly on time dutch ceo,0
SpiceJet,6.0,overall experience was ok,Rahul Anand,2023-01-08,spicejet is currently least preferred airline in india but as getting a good deal in last moment and schedule suits me go went with them overall experience was ok certainly not bad flight departed on time and reached before time as its a lcc so no meal included and nothing much expected the aircraft used was on wet lease from corendon airlines so even flight crew was from corendon as they didnt know hindi so that was a language problem with few passengers seat confirmation was same as boeing 737 operated by spice jet legroom was just ok for small route,0

SpiceJet,1.0,horrible customer care,A Postma,2020-03-17,colombo to chennai via mumbai the main reason for reviewing spicejet is their horrible customer care and their way of communicating so we tried booking on their website but after payment their website didnt work and we didnt receive the tickets after calling and emailing for at least 20 times the past month they keep asking the same questions without any progress were still waiting for our money back also the way they handled the communication around the corona virus and the forms you needed to fill was unclear we ended up waiting after arrival with the whole plane grouped up filling in extra forms that we didnt receive from spicejet,0
SpiceJet,1.0,absolute nightmare,Shashank Tomar,2020-03-17,delhi to varanasi absolute nightmare flight delayed by 3 hours after the boarding call crew took no responsibility no communication after the initial call for passengers to be seated,0
SpiceJet,5.0,spicemax doesnt mean anything,Rajneesh Modi,2020-03-17,pune to ahmedabad i usually fly spicemax most of the time to have convenience and to save time but that generally doesnt happen i have tried to provide feedback multiple times through their portal about their spicemax program but mostly it seems they are least bothered about customer feedback or customer satisfaction almost 90 of the time spicemax doesnt mean anything for spicejet crew i believe their crew lacks proper training or they dont care for people onboard i believe they should focus to make this program more robust so that people would feel like paying for the additional facilities if they treat the same to all than why would one pay the premium to avail additional services,0
SpiceJet,10.0,the service was excellent,H Mead,2020-03-17,we flew spicejet twice both within the country of india our first route was jaipur to jaisalmer our second was jaisalmer to new delhi on both occasions the service was excellent and the inflight snacks were generous  a can of flavored almonds and another of popcornlike makhana seeds we also arrived to jaipur 30 minutes early the seats were a little worn but since our flights were relatively short we didnt mind,1

SpiceJet,1.0,they cancelled my flight,B Prashanth,2020-03-17,mumbai to hyderabad very unprofessional as they cancelled my flight just before 1012 hrs of my departure and expect me to book a different flight where the prices are exorbitantly expensive the worst airline ever and would never recommend to travel in this flight ever,0
SpiceJet,1.0,arrogant very unapproachable,M Jhamb,2020-02-15,my elderly mum and i were travelling from delhi to dehradun after flying in from overseas very sad state of affairs with the ground staff  very arrogant very unapproachable and least helpful the girls appeared as if they are not their to provide any help to their passengers  apology is the least one would expect for a rather arrogant behaviour of  the female ground staff of spicejet  i sincerely wish this complaint feedback is taken up seriously to improve passenger experience,0
SpiceJet,7.0,a pretty good flight,A Sharvun,2020-02-15,kolkata to mumbai we managed to check in online and for the aisle  window seats a fee of 200 inr was shelled out however the middle seats were free the dinner was prebooked consisting of tawa fish and daal with rice during the check in all the luggages were checked in a proper manner however there was a delay of around 45 mins or so the seats were comfortable enough for a 2 hour 40 minute journey the service onboard was quite nice and the crew were attentive the pre flight meal was also quite nice and also had a plum cake and yogurt for dessert we landed at mumbai 1 hour after the scheduled arrival time but the delay was of little consequence the baggage was retrieved  swiftly from the baggage belt apart from the delay this was a pretty good flight,1
SpiceJet,1.0,we were declined boarding passes,Riya Tamang,2020-02-15,bagdogra to goa return via mumbai  our return flight time was 525 am and we reached the airport at 445 we were declined boarding passes because they said we need to arrive 45 mins prior and despite of begging the staff to give us our boarding passes they were rude  we were told that they had already started boarding on the flight and we would not be able to reach the gate in time this was a really horrible experience they told me that i would have to pay 1 lakh and 20 thousand rupees for just the return ticket which i of course did not buy i ended up paying 85000 rupees for the return ticket with a different airline i will never use or suggest spicejet to any one,0
SpiceJet,1.0,delayed again and again,Susant Guragain,2020-02-15,bangalore to new delhi really worst experience twice they delay at last moment and leave you with no option once they changed the flight timings and didnt even forward me the revised schedule the second time i had to wait for the flight for 3 hours being delayed again and again i would now prefer not flying rather than booking a spicejet flight,0
SpiceJet,1.0,worst luggage allowance,A Gamish,2020-02-15,hyderabad to mumbai the worst luggage allowance in india  i had 18 kg in check in luggage and 9kg in cabin trolley plus i was carrying another handbag  which they kept and counted as extra luggage which was 4 or 5 kgs i was charged for excess of 9 kgs i requested so they gave me 2 kgs off i paid 2800 such a waste of money rude and very adamant staff they have,0
SpiceJet,7.0,flight itself was pretty nice,S Vashun,2020-02-15,bengaluru to kolkata by spicejet as this was a transfer flight to my final destination in kolkata the process was very smooth and boarding started well ahead of schedule again this flight by a former jet airways boeing 737 and the crew seemed affable enough i had pre booked the non veg and veg lunch meal for my family members which consisted of a chicken and egg biriyani as the non veg option and veg biriyani as the veg option the food also had a bun and a cup of yoghurt and even though the meal was not bad the quantities seemed to be on the lesser side landing was in time however i noticed that as the passengers were deboarding the crew did not thank the passengers and they had their backs turned instead of thanking the passengers and this was maybe the only negative in what was by and large a very good flight the pre booked meal on spicejet seemed to be of more quantity compared to other rival low cost carriers operating in india but still if one has to purchase in flight it can get expensive as it starts from 250 inr onwards even though lccs are in the habit of maximizing revenue as much as possible one can be smart about this and perhaps have food before the flight the flight itself was pretty nice,1
SpiceJet,7.0,should not have much expectations,V Hanush,2020-02-15,mumbai to bengaluru by spicejet for this morning service there was massive lines for the baggage drop but eventually was able to drop the checked in luggage it is important to come well in advance as one could easily miss their flight due to the serpentine nature of the queues before dropping the bags it is important to print the boarding passes  bag tags from the kiosks the flight was operated by a former jet airways aircraft so the seating was more on the spacious side departure and arrival was on time the crew were also good i had asked for a glass of water only to be told that she would be giving me later but never did thankfully there was another crew member who provided the water unfortunately for my aunt the crew never really provided her any water when she made a similar request as the flight was full the crew managed to slowly get the service done but they did it quite well while deboarding the crew thanked all the passengers which was good when it comes to low cost carriers one should not have much expectations except from getting from point a to point b efficiently,1
SpiceJet,9.0,served the food with care,Akshat Yagnic,2020-02-15,delhi to ahmedabad the crew assisted me in putting my luggage without asking a seat was a little wet and crew deepika and dimi made sure to make the seat comfortable they served the food with care and delivered well in time congratulations for showing such dedicated approach towards work,1

SpiceJet,1.0,very stressful checkin,Jaijit Bhattacharya,2020-01-16,vishakapatnam to delhi very stressful checkin was not allowed to carry a single cabin bag and was forced to checkin despite having very fragile things the duty manager was most unhelpful and made false promises that airline will be responsible for any breakage and then promptly made me sign a document saying the airline is not responsible for anything fragile all reasoning fell on deaf ears most horrible experience as i am sure my things will break and the airline will shrug off their responsibility also i have the right to carry cabin baggage within the weight limits surely this is much last flight on a spicejet,0

SpiceJet,1.0,denied the entitled meals,R Hajira,2019-11-21,patna to chennai i had upgraded to spicemax considering facility of extra leg space and onboard meals but to my surprise so call legspace is a big disappointment as the space is very little and uncomfortable i was very rudely denied the entitled meals onboard by cabin crew member his behaviour made us feel humiliated onboard raised a complaint to the customer relations but it is useless as they have not yet investigated the issue,0

SpiceJet,7.0,service standard was adequate,G Carter,2019-11-04,dharamsala to delhi airline schedules only 20 minutes from the arrival of the inbound aircraft to the departure it’s impossible to turn around a q400 in that time so of course it was late the captain’s announcement needs work his ‘holding and bad weather into delhi’ announcement was too technical for the average passenger  he also promised an update but never did aside from these deficiencies the service standard was adequate,1

SpiceJet,8.0,some room for improvement ,Anand Limaye,2019-11-04,trivendrum to mumbai in general good experience however there is quite some room for improvement in areas such as the selection of food items training to the cabin crew cleanliness of the cabin punctuality in arrival and departure,1
SpiceJet,9.0,everything was flawless,V Reddy,2019-10-10,spicejet flight from delhi to bengaluru this was a very good flight where everything went very smoothly from check in using the kiosk machines to the baggage drop everything was flawless the boarding started before the scheduled time which was a plus point and the flight was very full one slight disadvantage is the need to pre pay the seat while doing online check in however if one arrives at the airport early enough one can select their seat preference without needing to pay the additional cost but then this is a practice most lccs do the plane itself was used formerly by jet airways so the seat pitch was on the more generous side which was well appreciated for a trip that was lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes long we took off before departure time the crew were proactive and personable enough with the fellow passengers when it came to the food  drinks the pilots also announced and kept us updated regarding the flight path arrival was also well before the scheduled time and collecting the baggage was done quickly without the need to wait for long overall id say that on flights with longer durations having a seat pitch which is more on the generous side really helps a lot would i consider flying spicejet again if there is a good deal available,1
SpiceJet,10.0,i had a good experience,B Hartosh,2019-10-10,mumbai to delhi from departure to arrival i had a good experience staff were polite and professional clean and very quiet aircraft,1
SpiceJet,1.0,an unpleasant and embarrassing experience,K Mickalova,2019-10-10,i was flying from kabul to bangkok via delhi and back the same route i paid for the spicemax or similar service  30kg for 2 pieces checkedin luggage not just 20kg extra leg room a meal and a nonalcoholic drink spicejet manged to be delayed departure time on 5 out of 4 planned flights one flight was so delayed that i would not catch the connecting flight in delhi  and i was not let on board thus i had to stay in bangkok for one more day no compensation for the hotel whatsoever the next day the plane was overcrowded  forget the extra leg room also staff were always checking xtimes if i was entitled for something to drink it was an unpleasant and embarrassing experience i will try to avoid spicejet at any cost you do not get what you paid for in many terms losing time energy and money when you cannot fly on the planned day is absolutely not worth it,0
SpiceJet,2.0,lot of false promises,Dileep Kumar,2019-10-10,i recently took flight from dubai to pune and i cant believe what great cheats they are first they are taking undue advantage of your situation and charging heavily for any excess baggage approx 1400 inr per kg i paid 15k for my excess baggage and they did that for most passengers and later all of our baggage was left behind as they did not have enough space in the flight and no information was provided to us they just keep making money by accepting all there is to take upon landing in pune they informed us what they have done and delivered a lot of false promises about refunds and compensation to pacify us later when i followed up with their customer care they didnt even bother to reply cause they know they have already got the money and later when i complained again they bluntly refused to pay any compensation or refunds they are extremely unprofessional and liars and cheats dont fall for their scams like me and from my experience i will tell you better to pay 1000 bucks extra and travel with other airline who dont do all this funny business and have better professionalism,0
SpiceJet,3.0,the seats were awful,Shilpa Khurana Shilpa,2019-10-10,dubai to delhi the main thing which i didnt like at all is the airhostess attitude even after pressing the button for calling nobody turned up there were 4 girls in the flight however they were rude and no smile while asking for anything disappointed  also the seats were awful the seat belt was torn  cleanliness zero our flight reached at 345 and we had to wait till 445 to get our luggage,0
SpiceJet,6.0,pleased with staff on each of the segments,Mahendra Sagar,2019-10-10,i flew three segments on spicejet dhakakolkata kolkatachennai and chennaicolombo and i was pleased with staff on each of the segments in particular the staff on kolkatachennai segment was very helpful courteous and pleasant its the crew that makes the airline truly on the other hand the systems of spicejet are broken two examples 1 on this same route i had a ticket with all three segments under the same record locator however since a flight was modified by the reservation staff their internal system showed them under different locators so i had to manually collect baggage and checkin baggage at every point  three checkins three baggage collections and two recheckins this needs to change airlines exist for customers customers dont exist for airlines 2 on a previous reservation that was cancelled by spicejet and refunded in full the full refund was issued as a new transaction rather than reversal of the previous charge due to exchange rate difference this resulted in a loss of 795 to me without having received anything other than headaches from spicejet,1
SpiceJet,2.0,disheartened by the approach,N Kardy,2019-10-10,coimbatore to delhi  we are travelling abroad the next day from delhi we were charged on an excess baggage of 4 kilos and paid 1600 we expected the airline to cooperate but had got no support it’s pretty logical that if somebody is travelling abroad on a holida  one is bound to have a little excess baggage a little bit of help could have changed our perception of the airlines we were disheartened by the approach we are not going to travel again in spicejet for sure,0
SpiceJet,1.0,pathetic seats and service,Binod Kumar,2019-10-10,dubai to pune very bad and pathetic seats and service baggage allowances are there to trick customers here dutyfree in also included as a part of baggage which is unheard in other places and airports,0

SpiceJet,2.0,nobody knew where was bag scanning,C Kanasant,2019-09-18,kolkata to bangkok bag scanning process before checkin was designed to help you exercise the airline didnt put up any sign so nobody knew where was the bag scanning station we had to make 2 trips for checking in and bag scanning which definitely werent pleasant,0

SpiceJet,1.0,one of the worst experiences,Deepali Bhamare,2019-09-18,mumbai to chennai one of the worst experiences i’ve ever had with a flight i was stuck in traffic and i knew i wouldn’t be able to make it before 45 mins so i called the airline and they said they’d mark my pnr and send their staff to help me with the stuff on reaching the airport and literally pushing everyone aside turns out there was no spicejet guy there to help us out moreover when we reached the checkin counter they refused to accept that we had our pnr nums marked and said that they couldn’t help us at all later the senior executive came and spoke to us honestly she couldn’t help us with the situation at all and later when we told her about the call center person who told us she’d arrange help the senior executive asked for her name and asked us to call her back and if we couldn’t do that we could book another flight she had a lot of attitude and just showed that she was least bothered in helping us they have stupid officials at their call center who just know what to say or what to do i’d strictly recommend anyone reading this to never use spicejet as they have horrible services this is just one of the most disastrous experiences i’ve ever had with any of the airlines later on we had to book another flight to get back so yes we chose indigo which is a way better flight than spicejet we had to book our tickets at the airport itself and since the ticket counter was very crowded the indigo official took us to book our tickets took our baggage and made it very hassle free for us,0
SpiceJet,5.0,ran out of all possible food options,Mohammed Nishal,2019-09-18,kochi to malé with spicejet it was a mixed experience they ran out of all possible food options by the 3rd row of the service itself we got to choose only some nuts and biscuits only crew were having either a take it or leave it attitude so didn’t expect much from them either nevertheless it was a decent flight with average seating,1

SpiceJet,1.0,improve your operational way,S Haksil,2019-09-18,mumbai to bengaluru without any prior information they are delaying the flight and giving reasons due to weather conditions and then said technical issue all other flights are flying apart from this weather effect only this flight even i call on customer care no and they said we are not able to help you  please improve your operational way,0

SpiceJet,3.0,i am highly disappointed,Akansha Singh Gautam,2019-09-18,chennai to guwahati via kolkata i am highly disappointed by their service i had requested them to put my baggage in the priority list and had paid extra as i was in a hurry for a bus which was soon after my flight i have had travelled in spicejet before and with my experience i already had a feeling that my spicejet flight might be late this is why i had demanded for the facility but even then they didnt put any priority tag on my luggage and my luggage arrived 15 mins late at the guwahati airport my first flight was 40 mins late the next one being 20 mins late i think spicejet needs to improve their services and at least provide the required services for the paid stuff if not free never travelling with spicejet again unless thatd be my last option,0
SpiceJet,1.0,they didnt load our baggage,Gillian Barber,2019-08-08,we flew from dubai to pune on the 4th and they didnt load our baggage its been two days without clothes or necessary items and medications and the airline is taking no responsibility offering no solution or any reimbursement for the inconvenience im here on holiday to attend a family function and my baggages are held up this is honestly the worst service and the worst airline,0
SpiceJet,1.0,nothing less than shameful,Rakesh Rachwani,2019-08-08,dubai to mumbai the experience of flying spice jet was nothing less than shameful  with spice jet you should be careful while checking in yes i understand 30kg is your limit but i saw a gentleman being asked to remove even 1 kg extra its of course the airline policy but this was certainly something a airline staff could have handled better having checked in without any fuss luckily i was  excited as i was taking my 1st international trip with spice jet  no one was allowed to check in hand luggage over 7 kgs which includes duty free spirits and other items bought  10000 rupees for hand carry without warning is insane,0
SpiceJet,1.0,our whole trip was ruined,Ujjval Jain,2019-08-08,i had booked four tickets from spice jet to fly from pune to cochin  it was a preplanned holiday and two out of four were on their honeymoon we had everything booked and scheduled  the cab itinerary hotel bookings and everything was paid in advance spice jet being such a reputed and big airline spoiled the whole holiday with their unprofessional ignorant attitude  we reached the pune airport at 10 am on 29 july as our flight was scheduled to fly at 1125 am and we issued the boarding pass on the kiosk and the same was sent to us on whatsapp by spice jet team we proceeded for the security check upon reaching there the security officer asked us to report at the checkin counter at the counter we were shocked to know that the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours and later got cancelled due to some technical issues spice jet officials straight away denied that they cannot do anything about it and we have to see something else on our own after a lot of heated argument they agreed on shifting us to the immediate next flight from the pune airport but we were given wrong information about the available flights too there was a go air flight at around 1 pm which we agreed on taking to and later on they refused us to accommodate in that flight we did not know what to do as we had a schedule to follow right after our landing in cochin  when we requested them for some other options we were told there was a flight at 4  430 pm indigo flight which is a direct flight to cochin we agreed as there were no other seats available in any other flight but when i checked it online it was via bangalore that was taking about six hours to reach cochin had i not checked it they would have shifted us there with this misinformation this is such an unprofessional behavior if the flight is cancelled last minute then ethically they should support their customer who is suffering because of the last minute cancellation rather than giving up on them and providing them with wrong information then i checked the online flights available and saw go air had an available flight from mumbai at 520 pm which was landing at 735 pm which was still suitable as we had time to reach the hotel at least spice jet team first did not agree to this then after requesting to spicejet senior team member that our entire money will go waste earlier he refused but after pursuing him a lot he booked us in the go air flight from mumbai the spice jet person after booking it told us that your bookings are done and we’ll offload you from the airport and you go and get a taxi on your own at around 1145 am pune to mumbai taxi fares are high we were not prepared for it and also we were not liable to paid it too when i requested they out rightly refused after a lot of argument they agreed for the taxi we took our flight from mumbai and landed at cochin at 730 pm our whole day was spoiled because of the last minute flight cancellation we are middle class people we plan the holidays in advance and take a fixed budget after this our whole trip was ruined,0

SpiceJet,1.0,pay for an excess of 2kgs,A Sharish,2019-02-26,bengaluru to pune spicejet is the worst airline in india the line for checkin was 1 hour long in short for a domestic flight you would have to reach before you are required to reach for an international flight in bengaluru spicejet counter you can meet the most incompetent ground staff despite the long line they were more interested in finding the tiniest fault possible and charging outrageous amounts as excess baggage this was the first time that i had been asked to pay for an excess of 2kgs and rupees 800 for the same the lady at the checkin counter would rather let me go and repack with the line waiting behind me than just wave off the matter and check me in,0
SpiceJet,1.0,spicejet is unapologetic,Jamila Kapasi,2019-02-26,ahmedabad to hyderabad via new delhi this is my 4th consecutive flight with spicejet that has got delayed its a hassle to rearrange my entire travel plan or wait extra hours in the airport spicejet is unapologetic about it for me this is the last time ill be flying spicejet,0
SpiceJet,8.0,worst flight experience,H Kubash,2019-02-26,kanpur to delhi worst flight experience ever the ground staff was very non cooperative the handbag was asked to be put in checkin to earn money the low carrier airline tag is just a ruse to fetch money from people by charging them with things like your baggage is 57cm and not 55cm  airbag with wheels is not allowed with 2 tickets our checkin baggage was within the limit but because they added our hand baggage to our checkin we were asked to pay extra and they charge a hefty amount of 400rs per kg the rest of the journey was made worse by the under construction kanpur airport they have limited staff and faulty equipment which makes the passenger experience a terrible ordeal,0
SpiceJet,1.0,worst experience,Kamal Gupta,2019-02-26,bengaluru to delhi worst experience travelled several times indigo but never faced issue spicejet is not at all customer friendly rude tone of staff not managed properly seriously in my life no one i know will book spicejet again,0
SpiceJet,1.0,do this rescheduling a lot,S Manehar,2019-02-26,mangalore to bangalore the flight was originally scheduled at 735 pm and got postponed to 915 pm a week before the scheduled date and looks like they do this rescheduling a lot why have so many itineraries to select from while booking if you actually cannot run those i called up the customer care and requested to change the flight to 540 pm which is available just so that the risk of missing the connecting flight is less but i was told about the policies and stuff that i have to pay the ticket fare  change penalty if i have to get it changed seriously guys is this what you call customer service the flight is rescheduled by 15 min less than 2 hrs which is the minimum time interval required for the ticket to be rescheduled free of cost according to policy when you say sorry we regret the inconvenience caused at least try to make up to the customer rather than making more money out of the customers inconvenience,0
SpiceJet,1.0,flight delayed by 5 hours,Roshith Kattungal,2019-02-26,cochin to chennai worst experience in flying the flight was delayed by 5 hours and the crew had no information even about the time at which flight was rescheduled they could have at least informed in advance so that i could have opted for another flight even though they know about the matter they kept mum never opt for this flight,0

SpiceJet,3.0,really bad service,L Sharma,2019-02-26,delhi to bangkok good price but really bad service they did not carry enough water bottles for all the passengers in fact they did not even have much food or other beverage options for customers on the later rows of the plane they had one bottle of water for 10 rows at the back had to call the attendant multiple times to get anything at all seats were ok not too bad the flight was also hot since the ac wasnt too effective only use as last resort if you dont have other flight options available much better to pay more for other airlines,0
SpiceJet,1.0,worst airline company,R Sharman,2019-01-01,guwahati to pakyong spicejet is the worst airline company they cancel flights when they could not sell there full tickets and blame the cancellation to bad weather condition they do not have the decency to inform the passengers beforehand so that they can arrange for an alternative you will know about the cancellation at airport thereafter you will have to run to spicejet office and request them to refund your money,0
SpiceJet,1.0,always a delay,Rohit Suri,2019-01-01,jaipur to varanasi consistent airline  always a delay i have an experience of delay in all trips while travelling with spicejet it takes something to be so consistent in wasting the passengers time the ground staff is arrogant while addressing the issue they are obviously obliging you by providing you the airlines although the flight attendants are courteous need to learn to be punctual and timely intimating the passengers about the delay,0

SpiceJet,1.0,improve before its too late,M Kaliya,2019-01-01,coimbatore to delhi improve before its too late i don’t usually do this but the reason for writing this review is manifold firstly the delay in flight time owing to poor weather conditions its hard to comprehend how other airlines can operate on time in similar conditions i just hope the delay was not caused to the airline staff secondly if flight is delayed then the same can be conveyed well in advance to avoid any inconvenience to a lady travelling with a toddler thirdly this really tested my patience the rude and indifferent behaviour of the lady at the counter at coimbatore airport she was not not considerate enough to check in the hand baggage meant for the baby and insisted that the same should be caaried in cabin i wonder if its the auw that counts and other airlines can consider why same thing could not be replicated by the spice jet overall it was a nightmare and a horrible experience i wish i didnt have to travel this airline again for you own sake improve before its too late,0
