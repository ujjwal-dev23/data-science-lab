AirIndia,8,“For the price paid flight was pretty good”,T Reddy,26th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | It seems that on the early morning departure from BOM to CCU, they have upgraded their aircraft from the A320 to the A321 which resulted in additional seating and so I was able to get a seat onboard this flight. Departure was on time and for breakfast had opted for the omelet with hash browns which was good. The crew were quite nice during this flight and landing into Calcutta was timely. For the price paid the flight was pretty good.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""the experience was extremely poor""",Joshua Heath,26th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Sydney to Delhi on flight AI301 and the experience was extremely poor, unacceptable service from the onboard crew throughout the flight. Before take off a ground crew member came onboard to inform me the entertainment system at my seat was not working. I was given the following 3 options: Option #1 They would try and get me on a flight the next day. I was traveling for business with multiple meetings booked for my arrival in Delhi which could not be changed. I declined this offer. Option #2 downgrade to economy. I declined this offer. Option #3 sign a form giving me Rs 10,000 credit, approximately $180AUD. I accepted this offer however considering my flight was 12 hours with no entertainment the compensation offered was extremely disappointing, inadequate and not reflective of the situation I was faced with. The most shocking part of the flight which was completely inappropriate were the crew members that took their sleep breaks in seat E & F of row 1 business class seats. In total I counted 6 different crew taking their sleep breaks for around 45min - 1hour with some even changing into sleepwear. Absolutely appalling! I did not pay a full business class fare to be seated in a crew rest area, unexceptionable and disgraceful. At what stage of air travel did crew sleep in passenger seats let alone in business class. Throughout my flight it was exceedingly difficult to get a crew members attention, even after pressing my call button crew would walk straight pass my seat which I witnessed this among other passengers as well. I had to get up from me seat twice during my flight to go and ask a crew member in the galley for assistance. Non of the crew were helpful or polite and I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience to their journey. I contact Air India via email following my flight regarding the crew taking their rest breaks in the Business Class cabin, astonishingly I was informed that “crew are permitted to rest in vacant seats”. So unless you want to sit next to the crew taking it their rest breaks I recommend avoiding Air India.",no
AirIndia,1,"""incompetence of this airline""",Alex Simion,26th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   Had a flight on 31 August from Bangalore to Paris with a stop in Delhi. Although the connection was 3h appart, and the Air India personell assured me that the baggage will be forwarded in Delhi, hey did not manage to do that. I am now 24 days latter, after 10's of calls and several tickets opened still not in the possesion of my luggage. Air India knows nothing, all they suggest is rasing another ticket. As the others I already have are closed. Not that anyone even contacted me once to tell me something. The sheer incompetence of this airline is incredible. I will take a moment here also to speak about the flight itself: aircraft dirty, not a little dirty but dirty in a gross way, like it was cleaned the last time a few years ago. Entertainment wise, 50% of all screens in the aircraft were not working, the ones that did had headphones issues, the perfect environment to spend 9h. This was the last time that I will buy a ticket from them and I really advice everyone else to not look at a couple of dollars difference and save yourselves hours of headaches. Customer support is inexistant, they answer, they barely speak english and all that they do is open tickets that they close themselves probably to look good in statistics as none of my tickets got any answer, or at least an automatic email saying that your ticket is closed. You just wait like an idiot and nothing happens.",no
AirIndia,1,"""disappointed in Air India service""",Mahesh Sharma,26th September 2024,Not Verified |  The worst experience when I decided to book tickets for my father with Air India. I choose the hassle free itinerary so that he doesn't have to check in the baggage two times but the opposite happened. While booking the ticket the airline hid the information about baggage self transfer in the transit and I confirmed with their costumer service agent two times that if the connected flight will have automatic baggage check in or else and both time I got the answer that this is same airline in both flights so it is automatically transfer baggage service. So I was relieved but at Delhi airport my father was told to take the baggage and self check in again and he was confused and called me to confirm. As of my surprise I called the air india customer support which was of no help obviously. Finally my father who is almost 65 years has to self check in the baggage. I am utterly disappointed in Air India service as one of the reasons I choose Air India because the transit would be smooth but it was the worst.,no

I had 2 carry-on bags, and both of them were lost during handling by airline. By the time, I received them I was missing all my money and valuables. When I made a complaint about it it was just a waste of my time, Delhi team was useless and instead of helping they give you headaches. No one take responsibility, that is main part which making airline zero. If you are reading my review I will say spend $50 extra and book other airline at least you will have peace of mind.",no

No reading lights. Worse than 3rd world food service. No cold beverages. Inexperienced young but polite staff. Panels on AC fall during takeoff Panels near foot rest falls off. Carbonated drink bottles kept loose which fizz out over customers $1,200 for a flight that was the worst in the 40 years of flying. Food service equipment not working. Cold food served. Bathroom out of service due to water leaks. Drink service at 4:30 USEST in the morning. Dinner service with no drinks. The flagship of an Industrial Powerhouse, which is no longer. Tata is milking the airline like the PE firms by no comfort funds, maintenance funds, no food funds, no qualified staffing!",yes

AirIndia,1,"""worst of my flying experience""",Amit Sood,26th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   On the way in from Sydney to Delhi , there were no sound and the return flight was even bad. We had three family members travelling together sitting in the same row and none of the entertainment stem were working. Insult to injury was that the flight attendants did not care about it and no effort was made to comfort the passengers. Somehow they expected us to accept it. Seats are broken. Think many times before booking with Air India as it is full of surprises. Better to find any alternate flight because these 14 hours of the flight were the worst of my flying experience.",no
AirIndia,1,“service is just getting worse and worse”,P Cooper,26th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airlines anyone can choose, I had a flight with my family on December 1st 2023 from Delhi to Vancouver. The flight was supposed to be at 5:15 am, which was delayed later to 7:15 am, to 10:15am and 12:30 pm, then again delayed to around 1 pm. Me and my family were in a transit from Cochin. The airline kept on changing the time without any notice. My initial layover was five hours at airport which eventually led a twelve hour stay in an airport. Once I reached my destination and contacted the customer care, they wouldn’t help me out with the whole thing, instead they said they will contact me back vey soon. Till this day they haven’t. This is not the first time I’m facing the same issue. From my experience never choose Air India, the service is just getting worse and worse. No sense of customer satisfaction or helping them. To say the airport staff are just communalists. Even though they know a person don’t know Hindi they just keep forcing and shoving Hindi on to your face. I have called the customer service more than five times still these company does not give a damn about there passengers. Flying on Air India is just useless and you won’t be able to reach your destination on time. If anyone need to reach a destination on time go for a different flight. Also if the cabin crew ask me every time do I need veg / non- veg. If I say veg they serve me non veg and if I ask non veg they serve me veg. Overall this flight is ridiculous.",no
AirIndia,1,"""service they provide is beyond the worst""",J Morten,11th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   Air India is the worst Airline I have travelled in the last 20 years.  I travelled from Cochin to Toronto via Delhi on August 27th. On August 28th after reaching Toronto, I realized 1 of my checked in baggage is missing. I filed the report at the airport, have been emailing all the India / Toronto contacts found, called customer care. The way these guy reply or respond give a single meaning they don't care. I have been getting no unsatisfactory replies or response from the moment I am trying to contact them and today has been 2weeks since reporting to them. The level of service they provide is beyond the worst. I am consistently emailing the customer care teams and relevant staff at Air India if you guys cant take care of the luggage's please make sure you revise the baggage policy.",no
AirIndia,2,"""I have asked for compensation""",P Hashel,11th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   While Booking we had booked flexi ticket for my mother from London to heathrow On 7 September 2024. She is 62 yrs old and was feeling slightly nauseated so I pre selected her seat for 17 C in economy by web check- in paying 42 pounds extra. Before boarding she was told that her seat is upgraded to 5 A in business class as she has high value ticket during booking. After boarding in 5 A seat, ground staff came inside the flight and asked her to shift to 18 C economy, by providing a new boarding pass. It was near to lavatory, already she was feeling nauseating, so she asked details of why it is changed after seating in seat, she was told this changes happen, and she was denied to even seat on her originally booked ticket of 17 C economy.  And ultimately she had to seat at a broken seat 10 k in business class, to avoid nausea and seat next to lavatory. It was basically a selection between backache due to broken seat and nausea due to close to lavatory. Cabin crew rajkumar and dimpy went out of their way to make her feel comfortable, But she developed backache after seating in broken seat. And crew of flight told to complain against the ground staff lady. We understand, it is management and cabin crew right to allow seating, but this is not the way of treating a elderly lady for no fault of hers. It's a recent event and I have asked for compensation, let's hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears like others.",no
AirIndia,1,"""18 hour delay""",Jean-Claude Albrecht,11th September 2024,"Not Verified |   18 hour delay in reaching my destination! Extremely poor management of flight delay in London, Despite 6 hour delay in leaving London and anticipated missed connexon, Air India insisted that we board the flight to Delhi (to avoid transferring to another airline) then transit passengers had to fight for themselves to obtain a transfer many hours later, Also, no entertainment during flight to Delhi, broken seat, just to name a few additional issues. I have requested compensation from Air India as I am entitled, no news so far, but I will fight to get what I am entitled for 520 GBP.",no
AirIndia,2,"""Annoying, frustrating and sad experience """,J Vogelmann,11th September 2024,"Not Verified |  Annoying, frustrating and sad experience I won't repeat. No idea how this airline can be part of Star Alliance with their standard being so far behind. Almost all entertainment screens were broken - dirty floor and seats with stains - no water or toilet paper in the toilets - horrible food especially for people who can't handle spicy or lentils well - seats in A320 ridiculously close to each other, got constantly slammed by the guy in front of me. This felt even worse than Ryanair but they're at least cheap, also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight - security at Delhi Airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but let's you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance? I have no understanding for this behaviour at all, Security also was unfriendly and arrogant. Absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change (360€ for 1 day later), might be like this with other carriers as well but I don't like it. Actually the only good thing I can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa ... try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines. I will avoid both Indian airports and Air India in the future, that was by far the lowest standard I have ever experienced by an airline flying to Europe.",no
AirIndia,1,"""ancient angled flat seat""",Dilip Kumar,11th September 2024,"Not Verified |   We booked lie flat seats with the new Air India airplanes (AI 183 from DEL to SFO) but they changed to an old airplane with an ancient angled flat seat which should not even be premium economy. They also refused to change to a different flight or upgrade the class of travel, claiming very high change fees - even though I had paid $4,214 per person. This is in-spite of me having knee surgery last year making travel hard for me. Would definitely avoid at all cost - new management has not made them change their ways",no
AirIndia,2,"""equipment is super old""",Vihar Deshpande,11th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   Just horrible. There are no hopes for this airline to get better. The equipment is super old, food quality is close to inedible and on-time performance doesn’t exist.",no
AirIndia,7,"""crew were quite nice and friendly""",N Hashun,11th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   On this flight, noticed that in recent times the aircraft was upgraded from an A320 to A321 which resulted in having more seats in Y class. Boarding started on time however there was a slight delay in takeoff. For breakfast went with the veg option that had some parathas to eat along with some potatoes which was fine. The crew were quite nice and friendly here and we landed on time in Mumbai. Overall for the price paid, and the fact that travel was over a weekend, there were seats available thankfully which made it all the more easier.",yes
AirIndia,2,"""seats wont recline and handles broken""",Chandan Prakash,11th September 2024,"Not Verified |  Travelled from LHR to Delhi in August 2024. Flight tickets were costly, even higher than BA or Virgin's ticket price. Two adults and two children were flying. what we got: An old aircraft with no inflight entertainment system, no charging points, seats wont recline and handles broken. only good thing was that there was a decent leg room space. Staff behaviour was as one would expect in the economy class. when i complained, I was told that a new A350 is being procured. but how does that help me in a really expensive flight on that day where the 9 hour flight seemed to take forever to reach delhi. In this age, asking about WIFI availability felt as if I came from the Moon. The quantity of food has been reduced so much now that I have started carrying my own.",no
AirIndia,1,"""customer care is -1""",M Sharp,11th September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst flight. Food was garbage. Totally frustrated, no value for money, deeply regret flying wit them.

Appalling. None of the TVs worked for the duration of my 24+ hours flight - two flights, two aircraft. This was my second flight with Air India (the return leg of a pre-booked ticket) and the second time this has happened to me (no TVs / no entertainment) so there was no excuse this time round. I flew over 30 hours from Sydney to London, via 12 hours layover in Delhi. This is unacceptable. On top of that, the toilets were disgusting, smelly, unkempt (eg sticky floors) and insecure - the bored flight attendants had a common habit of banging on the doors whilst in use and opening them from the outside, even when they were in use and there was no queue of people waiting to use them. Ambushed on the loo! This humiliating experience happened to me THREE times on one flight. It was embarrassing and unacceptable. Avoid this airline if at all possible.",no
AirIndia,5,"""Air India still has lot of work to do""",N Vankash,27th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   On 10th July I boarded Air India flight AI540 from Chennai T4 to Delhi T3 for returning to my college. There was no issue while boarding the flight as both the ground crew as well the cabin crew were very kind and responsive. But the main issue began in the aircraft where my seat 17F, a window seat, had a broken handle and a loose tray table which in my opinion would have come off with a slight increase in force. Apart from this the aircraft had a bad odor which made me uncomfortable. For the rest of the flight, I faced no issue and the food was good along with the cheerful cabin crew, but my bad opinion on Air India further increased when the flight landed in Delhi, it took almost 30-40 mins of waiting in the aircraft just to deplane after the plane came to a complete stop because of improper communication which lead to a lot of unrest among the passengers leading to a chaotic deplaning experience. Finally I say that Air India still has lot of work to do especially in terms of aircraft maintenance and proper coordination with ground services.",no
AirIndia,1,"""Worst airline available""",Tanmoy Mukherjee,27th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   Worst airline available in India, never book with them.

AirIndia,1,"""the worst experience""",Seema Malik,27th August 2024,✅ Trip Verified |   It was the worst experience and feels like the biggest mistake of our lives for booking with Air India. We booked our round trip tickets in January and cancellation was done by Air India in May. After banging our head with their customer executives finally we got one way ticket and partial return ticket upto Delhi only with pending Kuwait ticket. Then the horrendous journey started for the return flight. They kept coming up with excuses for providing return ticket with assurance that we will get on alternate flight on Air India Express which never happened. Everyday we lost 1 to 2 hours on phone with their customer executives for 1 month till 5 days were left for our return. Finally we had to book on another airlines with triple the cost and peanuts as refund from Air India. I EXPLAINED IN DETAIL SO THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL FALL IN THEIR TRAP. Hope it serves the purpose,no

The checkin lady made a mistake in entering my information that they were not able to let me board even though I could have missed my flight, my bags were re checked that maybe the Red mark was because of that but nothing from my end. The manager had to come and manually fix the error in the system. The plane landed 1 hour 20 minutes earlier than the scheduled time in Delhi but there was no ground staff so all of us were stuck in the plane for 1 hour 20 minutes without an AC.

No concern for consumers travelling even when there request assistance button not working not just for our seat but for most of economy but staff seems least concerned. Staff making faces which makes you feel you did a terrible mistake by making a request.

I confirmed multiple times that I did not have to pass through customs in Melbourne to reach the Gold Coast and they assured me this was the case. I would only need to collect my luggage on the GC. What went wrong: - they charge premium prices and not even have working entertainment on board that works. I was on a 12hour flight without a working screen (like most people) - super uncomfortable seats - 2 delays - lost my luggage Conclusion: make yourself a favour and not fly with these guys.

Then full security check again. We were compensated with warm water or juice box. But better to be deplaned on the ground than in the air. And, once again, no light, no call button, no entertainment and no apology. Generally the staff were good on the four legs - though conspicuously absent during the shambles of deplaning.

At the time of flying, Air India had not yet extended the cabin refresh to the aircraft type I flew, but the plane overall was clean and there were no maintenance issues onboard. Food was great as always. Communication could have been improved, especially since foreign mobile phones are blocked in Ladakh and there is no public WiFi in Kushok Bakula Rimpoche Airport, we were unable to receive delay alerts directly from Air India and had to rely on the screens and announcements which were updated at a pretty leisurely pace.

Terminal 3 of Delhi airport is huge and each unit is situated in various ends of the terminal. Not sure if it is the system they use or staff having difficulty to use their system, the process of check in baggage is very very slow. I was stuck with a very stern officer who took considerable time checking each and every boarding pass more than the usual time and when I had to go to the cashier she refused to accept and sent me to another end of the terminal for payment. Running about with hand luggage was not fun. The cabin crew were polite and the inflight experience was fine.",no

However, when I arrived at Delhi Airport, the airport staff told me that the fees is Rs. 22000 meaning $380 cad. I called the airline and they just apologized. I ended up paying more than stated due to lack of information provided by the airline. I have had the worst experience with Air India. When landed initially, they misplaced my checked baggage which I received after 20 days of my arrival in India and then at the time of departure, they lied to us relating to the baggage fees. This is not done. This airline should have honesty and good customer service if they want to survive. Totally messed up airline, never going to travel with them again.

Air India crew members are lack of knowledge to process boarding passes for seafarers. Another horrible thing that the manager was confused about required documents, not cooperative at all and was demanding unnecessary documentation like DG shipping B1 visa (such a document does not exist). I was denied to get boarding pass and it took almost 1 hour to convince him that B1/B2 are USA tourists visas and seafarers joining ships required only C1/D visa.

They gave all of us a Lunch voucher because flight was delayed by 5/6 hours (fuel issue) but the voucher was not accepted by a restaurant inside airport so I paid out of my pocket.

Once boarded, we were served a vegetarian roll. Said they are having catering issues and only boxed items are available. No notification regarding same was given to us until boarded the flight. Later came food in boxes with Vistara label (a sandwich, Haldiram packet, chocolate, granola bar). Vistara label is indicative that the airline was aware of the issue earlier. Why passengers were not notified either by email/SMS. No beverages were served. Had to ask for a coffee. Also had to ask the hostess to have the cup removed after 45 min. Lacking basic standards of customer service. Towards the end of trip, head of crew came to apologize for the catering issue. Return trip on 5/12 was in Economy class. No blankets were provided at seat. Audio-Visual system never worked. Should say there was food.

The Vistara label on the box indicate that they had prior knowledge about the catering issue and contained a soggy veg sandwich a chocolate and cookie for a 15 hr non-stop flight. The crew’s attitude was even embarrassing and no one even bothered to take the coffee cup back and it was done after a request was made and it took them 90 minutes to take the cup.

AirIndia,1,“poor management and bad decisions”,O Shaw,17th May 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | The Airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more. When the Tata's took over people had high hope for its recovery. However even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse. I avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless I have no better options. It's a big let down for a Tata company. I do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as Air India is now. I also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top Campbell Wilson. This guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner. Just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for Economy passengers. This guy says this is in line with the industry trend. Well I don't think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines. Even Japan Airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights. So what is the difference between AI and the other budget airlines, offering the same 15 kgs. In my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my Inbound flight from Tokyo. I called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore I wish to cancel. I was told that I can cancel but there will be no refund. I have never had issues with their Star Alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and I get a full refund in case of cancellation. Not only Star Alliance but numerous airlines with One World and Sky Team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit. Obviously this is another similarity with Budget Airlines. I definitely cannot recommend this airline in it's current avatar unless there is a drastic change which I do not see happening any time soon, definitely not under a CEO who is trying to run it as a budget airline. I also understand that the airline is currently at a loss. However with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty.",no
AirIndia,1,""" disaster from start to finish""",R Parjun,17th May 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  My recent experience with Air India on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied.  The food served was not only of poor quality, but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards. Packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior, making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing. To add insult to injury, the taste was abysmal, and the quality of desserts was subpar, failing to meet even the most basic expectations. Moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself, the state of the toilets was deplorable. Broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area, creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers. It's unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions. Furthermore, the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age. With technology readily available, there's no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity, especially during a lengthy 20-hour flight. Speaking of discomfort, the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory. Uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing, leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless. And if the in-flight experience wasn't bad enough, the ordeal continued upon arrival at Delhi airport. The mishandling of baggage collection, with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside, created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish. The combination of poor food quality, unsanitary conditions, lack of entertainment, uncomfortable seating, and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again. It's truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards, and I urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering Air India for their travels.",no
AirIndia,1,"""worst experience I’ve had""",Chris Dangelo,17th May 2024,"Not Verified |   This is the worst experience I’ve had flying internationally. On the first leg, the recline was broken. On the second leg, the in-flight entertainment remote was taped to the armrest because it too was broken. There is one little USB to try and charge gadgets not robust enough for my laptop. Oh, and the recline didn’t work either. For fifteen hours. Regardless, the economy seat backs are about 2 inches of hard plastic coated in musty fabric. Zero padding to be found. For fifteen hours. The extra 1” of legroom when compared to US carries doesn’t add much to the experience I’ve got to say.

They falsely claimed that EL AL had canceled their part of the flight, when in reality, they hadn't. This deceitful behavior only added to the frustration of the situation. Their failure to provide an alternative flight after canceling mine, as required by law, further compounded the issue.

Well, more than uncertain. When we boarded the plane, the cabin was heated to around 35°, which remained the case for the first 1.5 hours or so of the flight.  The seatbelt indicator lights did not work either. This perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft. While the entertainment system at my wife's seat didn't work on the outward flight, it practically failed throughout the entire plane on the return flight. And that on a long-haul flight. In addition, one toilet didn't work, my seat back was in a catastrophic state and one toilet was out of order. In another, the washbasin was provisionally glued down so that it didn't fall off the wall. Do you feel comfortable and safe? A clear no. It's also cheeky: when checking in online 48 hours before departure, the seats are displayed. Our two seats offered at no extra cost were in different rows. If we wanted to sit together or enjoy a bit more legroom, we had to pay extra. Coincidentally, relatives of ours were flying from Frankfurt to Singapore the same week. Here, too, the decision was made: No more Air India. After a lengthy back and forth with Air India, we were granted around 120 euros in compensation for both passengers.

Whenever I requested assistance from the flight attendants, their standard reply was, “We’ll take care of it for your side later.” Unfortunately, these assurances rarely translated into action. Whether it was headphones, desserts, or other amenities, the promised items often failed to materialize. Strongly urge the management to implement better checks and balances.

AirIndia,1,"""a nightmare that might haunt me""",Anjana Dhrestha,16th March 2024,"Not Verified |  The travel with air India came up being a nightmare that might haunt me in the future travels as well. There were so many big issues that I am writing this review so you do not have to go through the same thing I did. Too crowded and unhygienic.  For a flight of 12 hours we did not anything to entertain because the screen for almost half of flight was not working. Flights was delayed for almost 3 hours with no transparent information and from the beginning the delay time was 20 minutes which added up to almost 3 hours. Due to delay we lost our next flight which was also via air India and the staff at Delhi airport tried every possible way to make us find our own accommodation and even asked us to lie at Indian immigration parrotting us to tell we want to visit Delhi not the real reason that we had to get out as they couldn’t provide us accommodation within the airport premises which ended up creating a discussion and kind of scene. When I arrived to Kathmandu airport, I had missing baggage and its still missing. Only good thing was the crew team members ”air hostess “ were humble and helpful Avoid trouble avoid Air India",no

Flight time/duration and price was just too tempting to give AI a try and I am glad I tried them. I find their economy seats comfortable and good decent service. However, restrooms cleanliness can be improved. I did not care about entertainment system, so no comment on that. Hope Air India keeps improving. I will fly with them again.",no

Air India first changed our flight just hours before departure, they then changed it again later in the day. The flight was not cancelled for weather, war, or acts of God. No reason was ever given. After the changes, we were finally boarded on a different flight departing Monday afternoon, 2 days later. All during this time, Air India didn't offer any kind of compensation; no meals, no lodging, no nothing. We had to stay at a hotel 2 nights at our own expense. We wrote to Air India and explained the situation, asking they pay for the hotel and meals. They wrote back ""In the case of your booking to SFO we humbly convey to you that you were given alternate flight and that you travelled till your final destination"". NO mention of the 2 nights at a hotel we had to pay for. If they would have delayed us for a month, would we still be liable to pay for our food and lodging!?!",no

AirIndia,1,"""extremely dissatisfied with Air India""",G Halat,3rd March 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am extremely dissatisfied with Air India. Despite my family repeatedly warning me not to travel with AI, I thought of giving it a try. On my way from DEL to LHR , my inflight entertainment did not work. This has been such a common complaint from my relatives hence they warned me. I pressed the call attendant button but they would just turn off the sign. I pressed the button 4 times and on all 4 occasions they turned off the sign from their end. Frustrated I went to cabin crew area where they were just talking. I dont have any issues with them laughing and talking , it is their right. My problem is why they kept turning off the help calls? I explained that the inflight entertainment did not work. They asked me to sit. 5 mins later, a lady came and said its a common issue and the fact that the flight is around 8 hours, I could sleep during this time. I told her yes I would sleep but no one should be commanding what time I do what. She said maybe I can give feedback as none of Air India inflight entertainment systems work in any plane.",no
AirIndia,1,"""I asked for compensation""",Sven Olsson,3rd March 2024,✅ Trip Verified |  The airline is part of the Star Alliance but is not an airline that lives up to the normal standard. The plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment but the majority of the screens were not working. Might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem. Please prepare to have your own entertainment with you. The food onboard was really bad (normally I like the kind of food served in India but this was really bad). Take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by Air india. The plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good I would warn you for the not so pleasant flight. Service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good (I only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits). My travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours. When I asked for compensation of 600 Euros (not for a full refund) they changed the delay cause to bad weather and not technical issues!,no

We tried to get information and find a solution during 6 hours at the airport, no one could find a solution for us or give us reliable information. 6 hours waiting at the airport from 3am until 9am for nothing. Then in the afternoon, one Indian friend helped us calling Air India, we managed to schedule the cancelled flight by Air India for 2 days later, on January 17.

AirIndia,1,"""Our worst flying experience""",D Haysan,3rd March 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our worst flying experience. My wife and I were flying Air India from Ahmedabad to Newark via Mumbai. Our first flight was delayed (from 8:25 pm to 9:25pm) and we were informed just a few hours before. After arriving at the airport, we were told that our connecting flight form Mumbai to Newark has been cancelled and that we would have to fly to JFK in NY instead. We insisted that we would prefer to fly to Newark but no one could guarantee us a seat to Newark even a few days later. We were told no flight could be seen in the near future and that we should take the flight to JFK. Well, the flight from Ahmedabad was not delayed by an hour, it did not depart for another hour and a half (@ 11 pm). By then, we had been at the airport for 5 hours but no one offered us any food vouchers or water. After arriving in Mumbai, we had a heck of a time getting to the gate due to the distance and security check, etc. The flight to JFK was scheduled at 1:45 am and we were sure we couldn’t make that! Even worse than that is the fact that while we were trying to reach our gate, we heard an announcement for an Air India flight leaving for Newark!!! We were lied to about the Newark flight being cancelled and bumped onto another flight which reaches at an airport that is another hour away form Newark. We did not receive any prior notification as with the first flight but were surprised at the check-in counter. Meanwhile, the flight to JFK was delayed by a little over an hour and finally left at 3:00 am with us on it. We had to make other arrangements to get home and it cost us more money!! There was no talk of any compensation for inconvenience or any other options by Air India.",no

AirIndia,1,"""Absolutely the worst flight""",Gurjot Singh,2nd February 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely the worst flight I have ever been on. Was on the Toronto to Delhi direct flight and got a swift realization why I will never book to fly with Air India again. I was flying with 3 others that all needed special wheelchair assistance, so in order to even check-in we had to wait in line first before they would even allow them to sit in the wheelchair area. Now up to this point everything was a mild inconvenience. However the flight itself was what made sealed the deal of never flying Air India. For a direct long haul flight I cannot believe the condition of the airplane. The upholstery was dirty and falling apart held together with zip ties. The bathrooms were disgusting and also falling apart. The icing on the cake was a 13.5 hr flight with no inflight entertainment and being told they cannot fix it. See all the pics for what you are getting into if you choose to fly Air India.",no
AirIndia,1,"""My worst flying experience""",Mohammed Imran Ameer Amza,2nd February 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  My worst flying experience was this international transit flight from Mumbai to Bangkok. The aircraft was infested with mosquitoes when passengers boarded. The cramped leg space left me uncomfortable, and despite the efforts of the flight crew, the situation remained unaddressed. The seats were not comfortable for long-distance travel. Based on this experience, I would not consider traveling with Air India again, nor would I recommend it to others.",no
AirIndia,1,"""A very bad experience""",Akshay Jain,2nd February 2024,"Not Verified |  A very bad experience. It was a 12.5 hr flight from Delhi to Sydney. Supposed to take off at 2:15pm on 13th Jan from Delhi. Firstly I reach the check in Counter at 11:45 am and stood in the queue. There are so many counters for air India but any counter is not for a particular air India flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for Sydney or Dubai or London or xyz destination. Secondly there were so long queue that by the time I reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by. So finally at 1pm I reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop. While the staff was checking my flight details I just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 4:30 pm instead of 2:15 pm . Then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 4:30pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight, go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in. So which means I had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs; after that I have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage. What a waste of time. 1hr later at roughly around 2:15 pm I went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information. Finally I did a baggage drop and went further for a security check. After security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm I still had another 1 hr with nothing to do. I had thought I will be in flight already 2:15 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either. Slowly some time passed by and at 3:45 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 5:30 take off. This meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off. Then at 4:45 finally they started the boarding so finally I had some relief and thought ok no more delays now . Almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 5:15 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight. 10 minutes the passenger finally came. The flight finally started a take off at 5:45 pm. After all this once the flight was in the air around 6:15 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time. Finally at 6:45 they provided snacks and drinks.  Also from the time I sat in the plan the TV was not working at all. I informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food. They started serving food at 6:45 pm and finished by 7:45 pm . I told then again about the TV and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up. So I thought probably by 8:15 at least I should be able to watch something . Once the reset was completed and I turned on the TV but still it was not fixed. Basically I had to stay for the entire 13 hrs flight without TV. I had no option left but go to sleep. first long wait for check in ; second flight delayed by 3 hrs and third no TV",no
AirIndia,4,"""experience left much to be desired""",Maduri Asokan,2nd February 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently traveled business class with my daughter and elderly mom, and my experience with Air India left much to be desired. Our luggage was lost with no support or communication from the airline. The lack of empathy and remorse in the way customers were treated is unacceptable. Seeking assistance from a supervisor resulted in extra-long wait times, only to be met with dismissive attitudes. Holding a grudge for asking for help is not the kind of service one expects. I had essential medication in my suitcase, and despite carrying only a 2-day supply in my hand luggage, the lost baggage left me in a dire situation. It's now day 3, and there's still no news on the baggage. Additionally, there's been no communication regarding a claim or compensation for the inconvenience caused. The airline changed/cancelled my flight without any prior notification, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.  When faced with a modified flight, I had no flexibility and was forced to choose their option. Exploring alternatives was impractical due to last-minute expenses from other airlines and the urgency of an expiring visa the next day. Despite the hospitality and care provided by the cabin staff during the flight, the numerous issues encountered throughout the journey overshadow this positive note.",no

I booked this trip (WLG to STV via MEL and DEL, 1st leg operated by Qantas, last leg by Air India Express) as it was almost half the price as other airlines on this route, but also because I wanted to give Air India a go again. Honestly, I had a very pleasant experience. The check in process, baggage handling, comfort, boarding, cleanliness, ground and cabin crew, food and service were all excellent - on par with what you'd usually expect with the likes of Singapore Airlines. Crew member Pranali on MEL-DEL flight on 12 Jan was particularly kind, attentive and excellent at her job. Honestly I'd fly this airline again.

The efficiency and warmth exhibited during the check-in process by the executive at the counter set a positive tone for the journey. I was pleased to find myself in a new and well-maintained plane. The seating was comfortable, and the cleanliness of the cabin was impressive. The culinary offerings were delicious. The diverse meal options and attention to taste were much appreciated.

For Hyd to Del leg, passengers were asked to board after 2 hours delay and then asked to sit in Aircraft further for 1.30 hours. The ground staff and flight supervisor told repeatedly to connecting 27 passengers (to London Heathrow) that connecting flight from Delhi AI 165 is waiting to accommodate them. To our shock, the flight had departed 50 mins before we landed. The whole ground staff is rude. Eventually after so much fight for a place to reach final destination, we boarded AI 161 after 13 hours of actual departure (of AI 165) from New Delhi and have just arrived in LHR.

No attendants were seen anywhere. I went to the back galley, no one was there. I called the attendant by pressing the button, still nobody came. My reason was that my entertainment console was not working. On top of this, the lady seated on the aisle (in was window seat) was now taking up the aisle and middle seat and her head was almost on my lap.

Then, my transit flight’s time was changed from a 15 hour layover to 21 hours without any explanation. Delhi airport is not great for long transit.

But for my backup on my phone, it would have been an excruciating 15 hours to Delhi which the passenger next to me endured. Of the three meals served, two were almost the same. The caterer or the menu designer have to be changed immediately so that the passengers are not fed almost identical ill-prepared meals in quick succession.

AirIndia,2,“experience with Air India was challenging”,Bhawana Thaker,5th December 2023,"Not Verified |  My experience with Air India was challenging due to the itinerary and service encountered during the journey. The flights had extended layovers – a 4-5 hour stopover in Delhi on the way to Hyderabad and an 11-hour stopover in Mumbai on the return journey to New Jersey. This lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression. Regarding the in-flight service, it was satisfactory, although the food served from Mumbai to EWR lacked authenticity and didn't meet expectations. At Delhi airport, I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. However, there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering, which affected the overall ambiance. On the other hand, Mumbai airport was extremely crowded, and I faced challenges with uncooperative staff. Despite my long-haul flight, 11-hour stopover, and having a sick child with me, both immigration officers and Air India staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance. Their lack of empathy was evident, with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting I 'try my luck' with immigration. This was a disappointing and rude response. I strongly urge Air India's customer-facing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness. As a business class passenger, enduring an 11-hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience. I rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with Air India staff at Mumbai airport. Such attitudes are unacceptable when dealing with customers who expect better service standards.",no

To my pleasant surprise I did manage to get an aisle seat located at the front which was good. Boarding was on time and for breakfast I had opted for the veg option which consisted of some stuffed parathas, chole, a croissant along with coffee. The crew were quite nice and soothing and the flight itself landed uneventfully without any issues at its destination.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""experience was much worse than ever before""",Mercy Manjaly,21st November 2023,"Not Verified |  My Mother passed away May 21, 2023. I booked an Air India flight to travel May 21, 2023 from SFO to COK to attend her funeral. My family scheduled her funeral accordingly so I could attend the funeral. I was supposed to land in Kerala May 23rd at 0700 a.m. in plenty of time to attend her funeral the same day at 3pm. My mother’s house is just 30 minutes from the airport, and I would have plenty of time to reach home a few hours before the funeral. But unfortunately, I couldn’t attend the funeral because the Air India flight was delayed at SFO for several hours causing me to miss the layover flight to go to Kerala. I explained my emergency to everyone who were responsible, but the Air India staff didn’t care about it and rescheduled a flight that wouldn’t reach Kerala until 7pm causing me to miss my mother’s funeral. It is important in my culture and religious belief to be present for the funeral and events following. How can I ever reconcile this situation in my life in my heart? The traumatic experience I had with flying Air India and missing of my mother’s funeral is still difficult to come to terms with. It took me a long time to even write my experience in this portal. Unfortunately, this wasn’t an isolated example of poor service on this flight. On return to SFO the luggage was delayed 2.5 hours! We were given the reason for the delay as “there was no baggage workers to take the bags off the plain.” Not only was my time wasted but my transportation home was waiting for almost three hours. This is completely unacceptable. I have been a frequent international flyer for years, on many different airlines, and I was expecting a much better experience with Air India since TATA took over. Disappointedly, my experience was much worse than ever before. I was shocked to realize that Air India doesn’t have a suitable plan to deal with emergency situations like this. Air India will not be an airline of consideration for future travels because I don’t trust their reliability getting me to my destination for important life events. I feel like Air India doubled my traumatic experience, my mother passing compounded by not attending the funeral. This is a regret that I must live with for the rest of my life.",no

AirIndia,8,“the soft product was markedly improved”,V Reddy,21st November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had booked initially on economy class for this flight but was able to upgrade to business as there were a couple of seats available which came at a fee and I really wanted to see how things have changed especially on the business class after the takeover so thought this was a good opportunity. There is a separate counter for business class passengers where the staff was able to courteously check in and provide the lounge access voucher as well. The flight was delayed as the incoming flight was delayed and the crew were able to proactively communicate this fact to the passengers including the arrival of the flight which was good. It seems that even though the seats are quite spacious, this airbus 321 was also showing its signs of ageing as well. The seat also had newspapers / magazines which once could read but there was definitely an upgrade of the soft aspects of the product. On board the crew were welcoming and as a welcome drink there was a choice between buttermilk and coconut water and they have had also given hot towels which was very greatly appreciated as they are quite valuable which was not given before. Also there were menu cards distributed for the dinner option before take off as the crew noted down the orders. Previously the meals options used to be on laminated cards. I had opted for the fish curry with okra and that was quite a good and filling option along with a chocolate mousse cake for dessert. Unfortunately due to turbulence the crew were unable to do the beverage service which was good. Baggage retrieval was also swift. Overall I feel that the soft product was markedly improved from the last time I flew them in J class including the hot towels and menu cards with greater options but with the induction of new aircraft and refurbishment of cabin interiors I am quite optimistic that the business class product could get even better in the future. Only issue was the delay but that was due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft.",yes

Moreover, staff didn't even bother to help when I asked her if she can help me putting belt on my baby. She said the other hostess will come but no on came.

However, the food I was very highly dissatisfied with. They started our journey with cold baba ghanouj, and cold hummus with hard bread. That as a starter no one seemed to enjoy. Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was. An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer. After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset. Finally towards our landing, we were served frozen chat and a “veg grilled sandwich” which was in fact only bread and cold squash in it.

AirIndia,2,"""entire experience left us deeply disappointed""",M Kulkarni,27th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | My family and I have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with Air India. This time, it was my parents' first trip from New Delhi to San Francisco, leaving much to be desired. I had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents, as it was a gruelling 16-hour flight, and I paid for these seats when I booked the tickets. However, upon boarding the plane, my parents were assigned seats in the middle section, as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a last-minute payment for those seats at the airport. This was not an isolated incident. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from New Delhi to San Francisco. To their surprise, their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during check-in. It's evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue. It's deeply concerning that Air India's ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice. It appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online, only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during check-in. My parents were left with no other options, and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the check-in counter. This is a clear indication that there's a systemic problem within Air India, and this practice is tarnishing the airline's reputation. To make matters worse, I applied for a refund, but Air India never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats. This entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated, and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of Air India. Such practices are unethical and damaging to the airline's reputation. Air India must take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure that passengers receive the services they pay for and are entitled to.",no

AirIndia,1,"""deep disappointment and frustration""",Ravinder Kaur,9th October 2023,"Not Verified |  I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding my recent travel experience with Air India. On August 31, 2023, I had booked a flight (AI-309) from Melbourne to Delhi scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM. Unfortunately, this journey turned into a chaotic and inconvenient ordeal due to the cancellation of the flight and the subsequent mismanagement of the situation. The cancellation of the flight itself was a major inconvenience. I had specifically chosen a direct flight for the ease and comfort of traveling with my 3-year-old daughter. The direct flight option was the primary reason for selecting Air India for this trip. However, when I arrived at the airport, I was informed that the flight had been canceled. This abrupt change in plans disrupted my entire travel schedule. To make matters worse, the alternative flight that was offered to us, Sri Lanka Airlines to Colombo, was not only indirect but also experienced significant delays. This unexpected detour further complicated our travel plans and added unnecessary stress to an already frustrating situation. The lack of clear communication and contingency planning was evident throughout this experience. One of the most concerning aspects of this ordeal was the lack of consideration for the well-being of my 3-year-old daughter and me during the extended waiting period. We were forced to wait at the airport for 8 hours, during which no meals were provided for my child. This is unacceptable and demonstrates a lack of basic care for passengers, especially young children who rely on a regular meal schedule. The inconvenience caused to my daughter, who was hungry and tired, is deeply distressing. I must express my disappointment with the overall handling of this situation by Air India. As a result of this experience, I have lost faith in the reliability and customer service of your airline. I can assure you that I will not consider Air India for any future travel plans, and I will actively discourage friends and family from doing so as well.",no

AirIndia,1,"""seats were worn out, uncomfortable""",N Panir,9th October 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is regarding my recent round-trip experience on Air India flights from Toronto to Delhi and back. To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing.

We fought for some rest and sleep for lounge access. None was given, after much argument. Only a veg lunch voucher was given, estimated 450rp per person (there were 3 of us). In all of this no one apologised. The duty personnel in Changi Airport on the 9th past midnight to early morning 8.30am at the gate were hopeless and offered no sympathy or help. No one from Air India were at the transfer desk at 6am that morning to arrange for the new boarding passes. It was all left to Changi Airport staff to assist (and they were also clueless what was happening.  We were lied that we were to be placed on the 2.40am SQ flight to Delhi.

The Steward promised magazines to read but then went missing throughout the flight. The seat was broken. The food was terrible. The dry bun in food was not edible. They offered to give me free drinks, which I did not want.",no
AirIndia,1,"""avoid any flight with Air India""",Yechezkel Kashi,26th September 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight was canceled without any note from Air India. We even got an invitation to online check in and did that without any note from the company that the flight is not going to depart. This is only the beginning of a story of a nightmare and irresponsibility of the Air India. The next flight was two days after and we were stuck in Delhi and they refused to cover the minimum of the hotel for two days (they only gave us refund for one night). They promised to refund the taxi back to the airport but this didn't happen as well. In the airport, they lost our new ticket and it took an hour to get it back. We spent hours to argue with the workers of the airline and it were not honest. They promised lot of things but they were tricking us with all kind of excuses that were not real (they said there isn't more ticket in an other flight, and indeed there were, they said the manager left home and indeed he was there, and so on). Bottom line - we had a lot of expenses due to Air India improper service. We paid one night hotel, the taxi to the airport, food and living expenses and of course we lost two days of work at home. We didn't even get answers to our refund mail query. We recommend to avoid any flight with Air India.",no

No announcements or indication was given on asking about the flight. They changed the gate 3 times without informing us, I was only able to know about this because I was constantly checking the information boards, while some old passengers were not able to do it and were struggling badly. Secondly, the screens don’t work at all in the flight, even if they work the remotes don’t work, which is a big problem in flights with long routes. The food was good, staff was nice but all these challenges make it hard for us to opt for Air India again as it is highly inconvenient. Thanks",no

AirIndia,7,"""Business class is not roomy""",R Marden,11th September 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Business Class on Air India was just barely worth the extra cost. For one thing, they are using a domestic plane with one center aisle, so 4 seats across in business and 6 across in economy. There was nothing in the way of entertainment, not even a screen. Business class is not roomy, particularly when seats are reclined in front of you. Perhaps acceptable for domestic travel, but not for international. Service by the crew was fine, although they have an odd way of serving meal; the man next to me finished his meal before I even received mine. The problem with the menu and the choices is that unless you are Indian, if you are like me, you have no idea what anything is. Thus I ordered the one Western offering which was some sort of spaghetti mashup. It was not made clear to me that I also had a choice of appetizers and desserts. It certainly was a pleasant flight, if unremarkable in any way. This was my first time to have narrow bodied plane on this route. I hope it is my last.",yes

As this was the weekend the flight was quite full and I got to know from the crew that there was 1 passenger who was even allotted the jump seat. One thing that was noticed was that even though the flight was delayed the crew and pilots were quite apologetic about it and explained the reasons for the delay. However the pilots were in a rush and they didn't even announce nor notify the crew about taking their positions during take-off and the crew had to rush to their jump seats. On this sector I had noticed my co-passenger who was sitting next to me was not feeling well and the crew was constantly monitoring him and looking after him giving him bottles of water to make him comfortable which was quite great from the crew. For dinner I had opted for the non veg option that included a stuff paratha, chicken masala with rice along with salad and a chocolate cake. The meal was pretty good. Landing into BOM was on time and was able to also get my baggage as well. Apart from the delay this was a really comfortable and good flight.",yes

The Flight AI687/07Aug BOM DEL departure was revised at 1800hrs without giving any reason to passengers. Due to the delayed departure of AI687/07Aug BOM DEL, they were rescheduled to fly on the next day after 24 hrs. Had AI staff tried and communicated with staff in Delhi, there was a possibility to be able to catch onward flight for Tokyo. But no such attempt was even tried by the staff. There were other direct flights from DEL-Tyo (ANA or JAL) on same day which could have been the next option. But no sincere attempts were made. As a result, my in-laws lost one complete day. They were then sent to hotel Sukh at Juhu. To travel to hotel it took 3 hrs taxi ride and while coming back it was 2 hrs. My in-laws started their Journey from Nashik at 6 am in morning and could only reach the hotel at 9 pm. It could have been so easily a hotel near airport. On second day (8-Aug), they were picked up at around 11:00 am and made to catch 3:30 pm flight without lunch being offered. The hotel even didn’t have basic facilities like soap availability. As a common traveler, I can easily understand that 4:00 pm flight being very important for travelers who connect to other international flights from Delhi. There should be alternative arrangements to make people catch the connecting flights. If it was known that 4:00 pm flight is going to be delayed and there is no other flight available until 6:00 pm, why efforts were not made to accommodate few passengers who have connections in earlier 3:30 pm We had to cancel all arrangements made for their pick up and re-book the car with driver from Tokyo.

AirIndia,3,"""no different from a low-budget airline""",S Marton,7th August 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Disappointing Experience. I recently traveled on Air India from Cochin to Dubai on July 12th, and returned from Dubai to Cochin on July 17th. I am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight. When I booked my tickets, I had high expectations, considering that Tata Group had taken over Air India. However, I was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a low-budget airline, especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like Emirates or Qatar Airways. It was quite disconcerting to find that Air India, which is still considered a low-cost carrier, had higher prices compared to other budget airlines. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey. During check-in, I had checked in baggage weighing 26.5 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg. At no point during the check-in process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight, which would have allowed me to make purchases from the duty-free area. Instead, I was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check, and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram. This approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening, especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience. To comply with the sudden weight restriction, I had to rush back to the duty-free area and drop the items I had purchased. I was warned by your staff that I might face deportation if I delayed the process. As a Gold member of Qatar Airways, I am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations, so I complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue. This incident has left a significant impact on my perception of Indian airlines. I now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines, whether it is Air India under Tata ownership or any other Indian carrier. The flight experience itself was underwhelming, with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses, causing discomfort and subsequent back pain. Considering the recent acquisition by Tata Group, I had hoped for a significant improvement in Air India's services, but unfortunately, it seems that Air India remains unchanged. It is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines. This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns with you. I hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience. As a frequent traveler, I believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort, communication, and transparency to build a positive reputation. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I sincerely hope that Air India will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future.",no

Upon landing in Chennai, we faced the dreaded baggage problem. Our checked-in bags seemed to have gone on their own adventure somewhere else. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, the Air India representatives finally approached us. They were polite, but there was something off about their response. I couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't entirely transparent with us.

AirIndia,1,"""gotten progressively worse""",R Singh,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in.",no

The online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly. Boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger A321 for this sector. I had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see. Also surprisingly on this flight sector I had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich. I had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good. Landing and arrival into BLR was also well ahead of time. However when the time came to collect the baggage, I had noticed that again the new bag tag which I had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that I had just purchased recently and put. Even last week when I travelled from Kolkata to Mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off, so it seems that Air India is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into. But other than that, this was a welcome flight and I am hoping that the next time I travel, they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give.",yes

The air hostesses, Praveet and Preeti, were exceptional in their duties and displayed a remarkable level of professionalism throughout the flight. While the overall service was commendable, I would like to bring to your attention a minor issue regarding the in-flight entertainment system. Unfortunately, the screens in our section were not working properly.",no
AirIndia,2,"""entertainment did not work""",valentine Beatini,18th July 2023,"Not Verified | Bad experience. 2 long flights, 6 hours delay without compensation. On both flights, the sockets and the entertainment did not work. Not mine, nor the socket of the adjacent seats. The cabin staff is nice and pretends that the problem is solvable, but they seem pretty aware that it is not. For the delay, upon request, a ticket was provided for a lounge which was actually a loud café offering another meal very much like the one on the plane, and 0.33 ml water.",no
AirIndia,1,"""The service was non-existent""",S Jensen,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  With Tata having purchased Air India and Air India being a Star Alliance partner I thought what could go wrong. My new name for Air India is Air Never Again. The seats, service, cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible. We flew nine carriers on our month-long trip. None of them were close to being as bad as Air India. The discount air carriers Scoop and Batik put Air India to shame. The direct competitors Singapore, United and Cathay were so far superior that you'd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on Air India again. The plane was filthy. The seats torture devices left over from the Middle Ages. My in-seat entertainment system was broken but functional. I pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a, ""no, one cares shrug"". The service was non-existent. The flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service. They just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley. The food was the worst of any airline food I've eaten or tried to eat. The beverage service was miserly. Nope. One and done. Loved India. Been there several times. Will go again just not on Air India.",no
AirIndia,6,"""I would still recommend""",S Hashun,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I had booked this flight at a discount rate, I was a bit anxious about whether I would get a seat on this flight considering it was the weekend and planes have been flying full literally. To my surprise, I didn't have to wait for long in order to check in and get my boarding pass. The flight boarding and departure were on time and there were a few vacant seats. For breakfast I opted for the veg option which was consisting of an uttapam, sev upma, a croissant with mango yogurt which was pretty good. However, during the beverage service, I noticed that the staff were initially serving the front couple of rows but then due to turbulence they had to stop it midway but didn't bother to proactively ask the passengers for beverages when they were taking away the eating trays which was a surprise. Perhaps they might have just forgotten or due to the turbulence they had to stop it midway without asking passengers but either way that wasn't good. Arrival to Mumbai was on time however I had noticed that upon retrieval of my luggage, my baggage name tag that I had put had got torn out which was not good as previously back in January too they had misplaced my luggage and again they had not handled the baggage properly so this is something that they need to look into. I would still recommend as I got huge value for the fare that I paid.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""first and last flight with Air India""",K Singh,18th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I travelled in direct flight from Toronto to Delhi with my brother on 26 June 2023. The entire plane smelled like public washroom. It was so disgusting. The entertainment screen was not working for me and my brother and for many more people. We informed the crew member and she assured it will be fixed soon. Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it. When we asked the crew, she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange. You guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you, forget the rest. WE PAID $2300 CAD for the ticket which I think was not worth it. This was probably my first and last flight with Air India. Never travelling again and won't even recommend it to anyone.",no

TV screens were not working at all, while going to London only one screen was working from our row. But while returning back all three screens were not in a working condition. Also I had ordered a kids meal for my baby, but they also forgot that. If we had called them for any assistance there was nobody there to help. Staff were in their own world.

AirIndia,10,"""top notch crew experience""",T Sharma,5th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had the opportunity to travel on AI flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to India. I haven't been adventurous enough to try them out international as I've heard my share of horror stories. I'm going to base my review on the 2 Pune-Delhi flights I've taken in this period. Booking: AI fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines. AI is full service. Which means 25 kgs of check-in luggage and meals served on-board. A huge win right away. Online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites. Rating: 10/10 Check In: The check-in counter for AI literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones. That did make me somewhat nervous the first time. As it turns out eventually, the flights both times were completely full so I have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at check-in. Maybe fewer flights? Nevertheless, the check-in agent was quick, efficient, polite, addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate. I was out and about in no time - both times. No complaints. Rating: 10/10 Boarding: Boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled. On both the flights I took. However the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time. Rating: 8/10 Crew: On both occasions, the cabin stewards / stewardesses were polite, efficient and thoroughly professional. Albeit the first flight, they weren't overly keen to smile. On the second flight, they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please. A very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience. 10/10 The craft: This was an older A320. Not the Neo version. Strangely, there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and I had (non working) screen controls. None of the others did. I guess, they reused some seats from other aircraft. The seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers. At 5ft7, I had decent enough knee room. But the seat width - that was definitely a bonus. Wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights, but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer A350s and B787s. That made a huge impact and I did not have to fight it out with my co-passenger for rights over the arm rest. Of course, the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics. But it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting. Rating: 7/10 Meals: Dinner was served. Chicken korma with rice and some veggies. Some yoghurt and a brownie cake. Was decent fare. Served with steel cutlery. Thank you AI! International carriers make note, it's criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery. Why do you do it? The cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and I did a stress test, it was actually quite rigid and strong. Well done. Service was quick and as efficient as how I was getting used to by now. 8/10 Punctuality: Both times on AI, the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached New Delhi 30-35 mins ahead of schedule! I repeat - 30-35 mins ahead of schedule. On a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs!! This is serious WOW. Super impressed. 10/10! Extras: Throughout the trip, I kept getting emails and SMSs from AI with status updates on departure gates and other bits and bobs of info. I even got alerts for when my bags were loaded onto the aircraft. Who does that?! Whopping 10/10 Overall: An overwhelmingly surprised 10/10.",yes

After making us sit inside the plane they announced that flight delayed by one hour due to congestion, no news after even two hours and then started giving us excuses like ground staff clearance and after 6 hours sitting in the plane they started fueling. There were a lot of arguments in the plane with staff and ground clearance but they never listened. Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak. The pilot never came out of the cockpit to speak to the passengers, never seen such kind of chaos. Will never fly air india",no
AirIndia,1,"""web check-in was harrowing""",AP Pandey,27th June 2023,"Not Verified |  The web check-in was harrowing, they disabled the default free seat that was assigned after selecting another seat, and there was no way to return to the default option.

I travelled from Singapore to Bangalore and then boarded Air India. The flight left my baggage at Bangalore and I had to waste 2 hrs in Mumbai airport. I was told that in my baggage side pocket there was a lighter. I acknowledged and appreciated their promptness. On my return the flight was again delayed by 2 hrs. Someone opened my bag and lifted it. The food served inflight during lunch was also pathetic. I had planned to have my lunch in Bangalore however due to a delay had to rely on Air India.

Normally 787 has a high level of humidity and moisture but these aircraft were very dry don't know did they change the settings as a result you feel quite dry on these flights.

My daughter was super excited to go to USA and she said I will watch TV and play games to kill the time since she is not comfortable with long travel. Our seat number was good. To our shock, the seat was completely broken, no headphones were working, the touch was off and the button to adjust the seat was also broken. So, just imagine how does it feel when you are told that you have to sit in upright position for next 14 hours. I am taking Air India off my list now, never ever travelling back in Air India again. We complained to the Air Hostess, she said, ""Yeah can't help it, I will reboot the system, there might be some technical glitch or let me find some other seat for you"" but she did not do anything. I felt like jumping off the flight, my daughter was crying for the screen to play some games but I was so helpless.

AirIndia,1,"""Customer service is getting worse day by day""",Abhishek Raj,27th June 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India has very poor customer service onboard the aircraft. No flight attendant came to even offer water after 3-4 hours. Snacks were given before the beginning of the flight. In 14 hours of the flight only 1 time a meal was provided, there was also no warm food. Customer service is getting worse day by day. Everyone expected that since Mr. Ratan Tata took over Air India, he would make necessary steps to improve customer service, make flight tickets more reasonable and improvements in aircraft interior including TV screens in front of the seats but unfortunately nothing has improved. It is disappointing. At the airport after checking in for the international flight from Delhi to Toronto, my mother-in-law was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time. Couple of staff members of the STAR ALLIANCE harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to Toronto. I do not understand who gives airlines (Air India or Star Alliance) authority to ask for passengers return flight? This is ridiculous and I hope my message reaches the right authority in India to take necessary steps to stop such nonsense behavior at the airport. If I still had option for travelling with Jet Airways, I would never ever travel with Air India. Sadly, Jet Airways is no longer active.",no

AirIndia,1,"""AI has given nothing but lousy service""",H Norton,20th June 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Can an airline be this inefficient! From beginning to end! AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done! There was no order to the boarding! We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip. This is the second time I have flown AI in 6 months, for lack of finding any other airline and this is the second time I’ve sat in the plane for 4 hours while technical issues are being dealt with!

Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries. Seats were small and uncomfortable even with economy standards. Regarding the food, I bet it cannot be any cheaper than what was served. I have pledged not to travel with Air India anymore.

The staff at check-in offered me seat 4F at the front that had no other seats in front of them which resulted in extra legroom. Pushback started on time and once airborne the breakfast service commenced and I had opted for the non veg course that consisted of an omlette, chicken sausage with spinach and hash browns. along with a croissant and yoghurt. The meal itself was pretty good. However one thing that I had noticed which was not appreciated was the fact that the tray table was not properly cleaned.

But we reached airport little late (4:10am) they failed to arrange alternate flight for us and they told us to book new seats. They said you will get email after some time, as PNR is generated no issue. We trusted them and returned back to hotel. We didn't receive the email at all and we contacted the costumer service they also said its okay just go to airport and get the boarding pass. We went to airport little early (2am) with all our luggage, and child. When we arrived they said that in your name no seats book and all seats are full we cannot help you. We showed PNR number, they said but as you didn't get email we cant do anything. We went to manager of the Air India, she didn't show any interest in helping or solving the issue. We checked with other airlines. They had 2 seats, one seat like that so we had to book new tickets again with Vistara next day morning (3am) and we returned back to hotel again with all our bags (25kg bags, hand luggage) and child. Horrible service by Air India. Horrible staff members and irresponsible, non cooperative. They were all laughing making fun of each other and customers, no seriousness and no helping nature. It all happened in Delhi international airport. As we were confused and standing what to do, we were just observing them, they are so careless even for old people who are approaching them and they don't know the language Hindi or English.

The flight was scheduled to take off at 10:45 AM but was delayed until 5:20 PM (nearly 7 hours). Everyone had to deplane. Air India only provided each of us a $15 meal voucher for the long delay. On my way back to JFK from New Delhi on Thursday, May 18th at 2:20 AM, I asked an Air India check-in rep if he could upgrade me to business class. He said no because all the seats have already been taken. When I boarded and got off that flight, I saw that wasn't the case. I decided to submit a case on the Air India website and then was prompted to email [email protected]. I sent them an explanation on Friday, May 19th detailing all the inconvenience that was caused. Surprisingly, they replied to my email on the same day saying that they have ""shared details with the concerned airport"" and once they receive a response, they will get back to me.  I never received a response from them ever again. I requested a follow-up on May 29th, May 30th, and finally June 6th via email. I also called Air India on June 6th, but the rep kept asking me for my ticket number. I informed him that I've already flown and do not remember my ticket number. I asked him how I can find out this number. He didn't provide any assistance. Instead, he only repeated himself and decided to hang up. Very frustrating.

The plane was so old that the seats and infotainment systems were broken. People were literally trying to change seats to watch something in the screens. The most ridiculous part of all is that a manual in airlines said to not remove shoes. The people removed shoes and literally lied down on the seats, with blankets on, as if it were their beds at home. The crew did not care and was least concerned about correcting the mess. The washrooms were clogged and stinky. The attendant call was not heard for 45 minutes and till the time I stopped one myself to ask for water. I hated my overall flight experience. I don't know if these reviews are heard and seen by this airline to improve their service, but my experience travelling with them was the worst of all the airlines I have travelled with.

Seats were full of debris, window mirror was not wiped there were stains on it. Avoid booking Air India. Made a big mistake. After coming down to Goa airport there was a layover for about 5 hours and after standing in a cue for 1.5 hours for check in again the staff said you have to wait for ""30 minutes more"".

The major disappointments are old planes with no inflight entertainment, and incompetent and rude ground services. I would give the credits to cabin crews who tried their best to be helpful though. Check in staffs need to be better informed on visa requirements, so not to annoy customers with proper requirements waiting. India's chaotic airport security is already a nightmare, but a ground staff in Delhi made it worse. In my experience, airport security staffs made a horrible mistake of not stamping my boarding pass. And an Air India staff at the boarding gate was very rude as if I was someone with a security risk. He made me wait to board the plane last without a proper explanation, to a point that a security lady was nice enough to give a calming gesture and signalling the boarding staff is rather a rude one.",no

The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.

The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best.

Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue.

The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone.

But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good.

When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18.

As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip.

My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",no

After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name.

AirIndia,3,"""Complete disaster""",Neeraj Jaggi,18th March 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",no

Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious.

As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.

To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight.

AirIndia,8,"""service was quite nice""",V Abbas,5th March 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved.",yes

The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days.

She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help.

AirIndia,1,"""hygiene on these flights is horrendous""",Sagel Patel,14th January 2023,"Not Verified |  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.",no

Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again.",no
AirIndia,1,"""Air India is disgusting""",Sana Patel,14th January 2023,✅ Trip Verified |  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.,no
AirIndia,5,"""does not reflect well on the new owners""",V Reddy,14th January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers. I have already had 2 negative experiences travelling on the airline within the space of 2 months.",no

You’d never come across a staff smiling (ground or air), the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the Govt owned airline. Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available. Pathetic service and they do not deserve any sympathy.",no

AirIndia,1,"""Worst experience of my life""",J Landon,2nd January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life. I paid more than $1500 to get to India from the US even though there were flights for $900. The reason is that Air India had a non-stop flight from the US. I tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight. Although I requested English speaking reps on the 800 number, all the people had only elementary understanding of English. And, for some reason, they would hang up the phone in mid-conversation. I even had a friend call and the same happened to her. I ended up talking another airline to India and flying back on Air India which was horrible and I do not recommend it. I also want to warn people. My card was charged almost $1517.49 Air India admitted the problem was on their end but I was only refunded $1253.66 For some reason they decided to keep $264.33 That is the first issue. The second was the actual flight.  I was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water. I asked if they had a larger cup because I was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didn't understand English or she pretended she didn't understand English, because she shrugged and walked away. The food was horrible, the seats were horrible and had very little room, non of the screens worked and, even worse, none of the outlets that are in planes for recharging your device worked. When I ran out of battery on my iPad I tried to read but the light did not work in my entire row. One of the worst experiences on multiple levels. please , if you want to protect your money, and your comfort, look for another airlines.",no
AirIndia,1,"""Complete waste of money""",P Reddy,2nd January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst airline experience I've ever had. While flying from Sydney to Delhi, no gluten free food was available despite it being confirmed on the air ticket. While returning, only one of the three in flight entertainment systems were working in our row. That's 12.5 hours of staring at a screen that doesn't work with nothing else to do. This is also despite having paid close to $7000 for our flights. Complete waste of money - unlikely to ever fly with them again.",no

AirIndia,3,"""dropped the ball here big time""",V Agar,2nd January 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I was booked on a waitlist flight from CCU to BOM this morning which was pretty much overbooked especially in mid week which was surprising. I had resigned myself to not getting any seat on the flight as it was pretty full but then at the last moment the supervisor managed to print my boarding pass and I believed that I was actually going to fly onboard the flight. Or so I thought. After clearing the serpentine security line I rushed to the boarding gate hoping to catch my flight. And that is when a big surprise was up in store for me where it was revealed by the boarding gate agents that I would be unable to board as a regular pax had taken my place. This was pretty jarring, especially at the last moment. So I then had to make my way back to the check in desk to retrieve my luggage which had to be offloaded from the flight. The point here is why was the boarding pass issued to me when there was no guarantee that I would get a seat onboard the flight? If the staff had informed me that there are no seats I would have understood and resigned myself to that fact. Instead by printing my boarding pass it gave me a false sense of hope which was clearly not correct. The purpose of me writing this review is not to bash anyone but to highlight there there are certain aspects of waitlist bookings that should be handled better here. I may also have to reconsider going for waitlist bookings with the airline if this practice continues. And in this regard, Air India dropped the ball here big time. I hope that the airline takes the feedback onboard here regarding this.",no

Both flights were +- full. What baffled me was, why someone in Air India would deploy this aircraft configuration for an International ""long haul"" 5.5hrs flight with seats with no seat pocket? The back of the seat only has document holder. The cabin had no power supply, no USB port so at least have seat pockets that allow customers to place their power bank in the seat pocket while charging their gadget instead of having to place the power bank in-between one's groin region. My other AI domestic flights BOM-GOI and return, had seat pockets for a 90 minute flight. This could have been a 10/10 review.",no

The check in staff at Melbourne were pleasant, helpful and efficient. We had to queue but the line kept moving. The ground staff member was cheerful and upbeat and really seemed to enjoy talking to people and took pride in his job. Our boarding was on time and orderly and our flight departed exactly on time. The highlight was the attitude of the cabin crew.  During the twelve hour flight, our cabin crew were absolutely delightful: They looked happy and we had a nice chat about the Indian wines being served on Air India during the bar service. They emanated a sense of warmth and caring. The professionalism and warmth of the cabin crew on this flight was probably the best we have ever experienced.

Every time they assured that the money will be refunded within next seven days but this excuse has been repeated for about seven times till date but to no avail.

The air hostess calling light were only lighting on top of the passenger seat panel but air hostess don’t have any clue that passenger is calling them.

I felt pain after the first hour, even after I placed the neck pillow provided, it didn't help. The food was good, the toilets were clean, the stewards were not stingy on the drinks and snacks. The main reason I opted for this is because this is the only direct flight to Kochi and I thought I would be able to adjust for a 9hr flight, but I was proved wrong. The touch screen didn't work, the USB charging port and the headphone jack connector was broken. The steward was handing out landing cards to certain passengers and they should have just informed the people over the intercom to identify themselves if they needed one, I had to call out to them and then comes a volley of questions, are you a foreign national, etc.. why do they care? We know we need to fill it, this is not the first time we are traveling to India!

No blankets were provided and the food quality was inadequate. Inward journey: The entertainment system didn't work at all even though the staff tried resetting it three times.

Both ways we had the worst experiences regarding meals and baggage collection and transfer from aircraft to airport in Bangalore. Despite being in Business class, there was no decent meal available for people, who wanted to eat light and non spicy food. Seeing this, we booked a blend and one jain meal on our return flight. Shockingly, the blend food was spicy and had garlic in it and jain meal was also too spicy. The crew expressed inability to provide us any alternative, even such as fruits. The baggage in Bangalore could be collected by us after 45 minutes, despite having 'priority' tag on it. On reaching Delhi Airport on 8th November, it was worst. The flight attendant announced belt number-1 for baggage collection at the time of de-boarding. We waited for 30 minutes and then started searching from belt to belt and finally found our baggage for IA-507, was off loaded on belt number-5. Again after waiting for a long time, we were able to finally collect baggage. Both sides, the experience was terrible. Also that a lady seated on a seat ahead of us behaved in a very rowdy manner throughout the flight. Despite my telling the flight attendant, she did nothing about it.

The check in was done properly and the last time I travelled on the airline post the Tata takeover, they had reduced the meal service so was skeptical over what the meal service was going to be like on this flight because the last time I travelled, only a sandwich as provided. The boarding started on time however the pushback got delayed by 30 mins due to the congestion at Mumbai airport which is the norm. I was also pleased to note that the ground staff offered me an extra legroom seat which was greatly appreciated. For the breakfast service I was pleasantly surprised as they were offering full breakfasts with both vegetarian as well as non vegetarian fares whereas previously only vegetarian was offered. The cutleries stainless steel instead of plastic which was a great touch. For the vegetarian fayre, it consisted of idlis, poha, croissant as well as mango yogurt along with tea / coffee which was great. The arrival was delayed by 30 minutes. But overall this was great value for money as I had got an extra legroom seat, a full breakfast with steel cutleries and good staff and crew service.

AirIndia,7,"""a very comfortable experience""",Venkitarayan Pallipuram,19th November 2022,Not Verified |  Had taken AI 186 in business class on 1st November with my wife and we had a very comfortable experience right from Check in. Flight took off in time and had good comfort and our seats were good and very courteous staff. Food was also OK for us and flight landed in Delhi one hour before the scheduled arrival time.

AirIndia,8,"""ticket was cheaper by 40%""",Ramapati Singhania,19th November 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  My flight Dubai - Chennai was very comfortable in seat 2D. Of course the plane was very old. The safety announcements were antiquated. Entertainment systems were absent. And the seats had limited reclining. But the ticket was cheaper by 40% so I was happy to accept these shortcomings. And the plane was on time.  The 2 lady flight attendants were very attentive and empathetic. I had ordered a gluten free meal and they made sure I was comfortable with it.,yes
AirIndia,1,"""do not care for their customers""",Agnes Chadi,19th November 2022,Not Verified |  I took air india in December 2021 and June 2022. On my return I wanted to claim the milage. Something went wrong and I couldn't access the flying return milage program. For last 5 months I have contacted air india staff in vain. Tons of back and forth emails and number of calls at customer service number. They keep passing me from person to person and asking for same document multiple times. I am fed up and frustrated following up with the AI staff and come to conclusion that they have a bunch of staff who do not care for their customers. One of the poorest customer service of an international company. What a pity. Be careful if you ever want to take Air India. There are options people and we deserve a better deal.,no
AirIndia,1,"""seats were very uncomfortable""",Mary Jones,25th October 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  A very old aircraft. I got moved twice because the seat buttons were not working. The seats were very uncomfortable. The tv screen was hazy and unclear. Entertainment was limited to 5 English movies! The map route was not available and the vegetarian breakfast was disgusting. No flavor. The captain came on the speakers twice, at departure and arrival. Most announce the altitude and give a few details of how the route will be.",no
AirIndia,1,"""Airport staff is not trained well""",Lalita Basra,25th October 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Airport staff is not trained well. Everyone was giving me the different information. Do not know what is the next step. Taking hours for work should be done within minutes. Took double the amount of fee for one baggage. Trying to contact customer service and agents are saying they cannot do anything and I should speak to Delhi airport wow is that even possible. What are they working for?,no
AirIndia,3,"2seats are broken in business class""",Simi Seth,25th October 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  The seats are broken in business class and band aids were applied when shared with the air hostess. They should not be putting passengers on such unsafe seats where the handles are wobbly!,no

AirIndia,2,"""very poor experience""",J Basan,25th October 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very poor experience. Only highlight was access to lounge at HTR airport which was Singapore Airlines lounge. Flight experience - seats are not as comfortable as one would expect in business class. Very old seats with poor cushion. seats in row 1 is very narrow. Flight entertainment did not work so made the flight very noisy. Food was not up to business class standard. Did not get wash bag when flying out, not sure why. Flight from Delhi to London - food was very poor. A menu was supplied only to be told that options on the menu not available. Food tasted poor quality and dry. Airport lounge at Delhi airport was not up to standard - food was limited choice, not enough provisions. I would give a zero rating for inflight entertainment and food if I had a choice.",no
AirIndia,9,"""very customer friendly""",Shovan Das,25th October 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very well maintained. Cabin crews were  amicable and very customer friendly.

AirIndia,9,"""smooth and comfortable flight""",H Gardav,30th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked Air India after reading many negative reviews to see how bad it really was. Turned out to be a pretty smooth and comfortable flight. Quick & efficient check-in staff. Plane arrived early, we departed early and reach much before the scheduled arrival time. The cabin crew was courteous and professional. Snacks served were very basic but of good quality. Emphasis was made on covid safety protocols. Baggage reclaim was quick. Though the aircraft was 12.6 years old and did show some signs of ageing, the cabin was quite clean and in a good condition despite the years of wear.",yes
AirIndia,8,"""a great experience for us2",Reena Makkar,30th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Both me and my husband travelled in business class on the 25th September. The flight was very comfortable. The air hostesses went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. We were provide with amenities including a night suit. The food was more than sufficient and extremely tasty. I will like to specially mention the cabin supervisor Kalpana and her team members Varsha, Preeti and Makarand. I have come across a lot of negative comments about Air India but honestly it was a great experience for us.",yes
AirIndia,4,"""Outdated aircraft""",Nikhil Jasrotia,30th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outdated aircraft. The entertainment system's screen could barely be seen. A very laggy interface. (This was on either legs of the flight. BLR-MUM-LHR & the return leg) The company needs to immediately look to upgrade their high traffic/revenue routes for start. Selection of alcohol was pathetic. They're only offering cheap IMFL liquor Sula wine & Blenders Pride. Ballentine though part of selection, was over shortly. Professional staff, who know how to manage the odd unruly passenger or support the elderly. If AI has anything to be thankful for, it is their staff.",no
AirIndia,7,"""Will travel again""",V Jaydel,30th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Service was very good. Some minor problems but bearable as the price was close 1000 usd cheaper. The arm rest falling apart, choices on TV had 7 categories but only movies and TV options were working About 4 seats were not functioning. They blocked off those seats and accommodated the passengers in other available seats Staff was very attentive. Will travel again",yes
AirIndia,8,"""Smooth experience""",Rahul Anand,30th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Smooth experience, early morning flight from Delhi. Aircraft was almost empty, with capacity around 200 passengers of A321 it was having only 60 passengers. Requested by cabin crew to occupy emergency exit seat to fulfil the emergency protocol. Crew were courteous, flight was on time, seats of Air India economy is best of domestic carriers. They only served a sandwich, 
 even that was not required.",yes
AirIndia,7,"""offers 20kg baggage allowance""",Rahul Anand,30th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flown on an early morning Mumbai to Delhi flight. Departed on time and so was arrival. Air India is the only domestic airline which offers 20kg baggage allowance whereas rest all offers 15kg. Seat pitch of Air India is better than any other domestic airline. Cabin was clean and fresh but due to mishandling and mismanagement by previous management the seats are bit old, new management needs to refurbish now. Served good breakfast on the way, Staff were courteous and good service on board.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""We had the worst experience""",Jyoti Nair,30th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  We had the worst experience flying with Air India. I was flying with my 12 year old son and I had hurt my knee and needed a wheel chair. The food was horrible on the flight. Tasteless food and our television set was not working. We were traveling 14 hours without a TV. The crew tried their level best to reset it but it just would not work. The ground staff at Delhi Airport was just horrible. They have a huge badge that says no tips but since he has to help me from international to Domestic and take my luggage from I decided I would pay him 1000 Rupees which I thought was a fair tip. But he started demanding more money and n dollars. His friends came there too asking what’s the matter.  He told me that he took me their short cuts so he has to share the money thru the official thru. Wow Air India. Your officers don’t get paid that they loot us? Finally he settled for 60$. Why when all other air line employee or for that matter Air India ground staff in the USA won’t demand money why in India do they literally take advantage of you? Shameless.,no
AirIndia,8,"""The airline has improved""",Vivek Anand,30th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  The airline has improved in terms of great customer service, a courteous cabin crew, and excellent food and beverages served.

At check-in the staff wanted our vaccine certificate and Airseva app downloaded. This was not known whilst booking or was any email sent prior to the day of departure. This resulted in huge chaos at check-in as lot many didn’t know. The aircraft seats were torn, and dirty, and the handrest and other parts of the seat were held together with fraying masking tape. The cabin partitions and carpet were covered with grime. The flexible arm of the display wouldn’t stand up, and the wired remote was broken and temperamental. The Upma & Vada served for breakfast was undercooked and stale. The bread roll was cold and tough as a rubber pad. Food didn't get any better on the 12-hour flight. Snacks were meagre to non-existent. I have used public urinals, which are cleaner than the toilets on board. The in flight service and cleanliness on this route were much better before the change of ownership.",no
AirIndia,1,"""supposedly too late for boarding""",Vamshi Krishnan,30th September 2022,"Not Verified |  I have been a frequent flier in Air India being a government employee, took a sigh of relief when it got privatised, which meant that I no longer had the compulsion to fly the same. However, against my better judgement I booked a flight from Delhi - Madurai via Chennai on 18 Sep. Reached the airport about an hr and thirty mins early as I was already travelling from Jammu. But due to the overall rush at the entrance and que, reached the counter 55 MINS prior to departure, but to my horror I was refused a ticket as the ‘Wonderful Server of Air India’ didn’t take web checkin and I was supposedly too late for boarding. The same was the case with four more passengers on same flight and even on the request of so many passengers, no body triers to hear the problem or help. the Manager was rude to the hapless passengers.",no
AirIndia,1,"""won't fly Air India again""",Advay Biswal,15th September 2022,"Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever experienced. The ground staff is very rude. And most of the time the In Flight Entertainment doesn't work. The call button in the flight doesn't work, it took me 20 minutes to call a flight attendant. The food is horrible. The seats are very unhygienic, the tray table is also very dirty. After arriving on the airport, it took 30 minutes just for the first bag to come, and when I received mine, it was a bit damaged from the side. Terrible airline, won't fly Air India again.",no
AirIndia,6,"""new ownership is interested in cutting costs""",N Shavun,15th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  The fare was booked at a cheaper fare which was good. The check in process and the ground staff was also good. The boarding started on time. However my experience related to the food and catering has been the opposite. Seems Air India has dropped the ball with regards to the food on board. Previously before it got privatized, they used to provide a full breakfast with tea / coffee as part of it's morning service. This time when I traveled post the takeover, instead of the breakfast, all we got was a sandwich. No beverages at all. Air India's food and catering was always it's strong point even before it got privatized (along with seat pitch and baggage allowance). But it seems that the new ownership is interested in cutting costs and then marketing this as as some sort of ""innovation"" to the gullible flying public. There are so many other aspects of the airline that need to be improved. Instead what the owners have done is turned a strength into a weakness.",yes
AirIndia,1,"""Worst flight I ever had""",Jen Thomas,15th September 2022,"Not Verified |  Worst flight I ever had. I paid money and they even did not provide basic needs. TV was there and it wasn't working, and you can understand how I feel that for a long flight. I asked cabin crews for few things and honestly speaking, restaurant staffs are way more better than them. They were too rude and I became really scared to ask even for a glass of water. Guys, please, we are spending too much money on this airline atleast provide what we deserve. Please do train your staff, please make sure things are working, it is a request.",no
AirIndia,3,"""Leg space was also very small""",Hussain Lokhandwala,15th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  They are providing TV but not allowing to use us. In Air india on same day I was travelling in 2 flights in both meals were included but in both they gave us the same meal in which they gave sandwich with a water bottle. This sandwich taste is very bad we ask them to give another food for which we were ready to pay but they had no other options. Leg space was also very small. There were no wifi connection.,no
AirIndia,1,"""Totally poor service""",Harjinder Bamrah,15th September 2022,Not Verified |  I travelled in January 2022 from Toronto to New Delhi. Airplane seat were very dirty. No tv screen was working. No maps monitor was working. Ticket price was very expensive. Totally poor service.,no
AirIndia,1,""" My seat stopped reclining""",Sahil Malhotra,15th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rock hard seats (even in business), infotainment system worked thankfully, but the movies collection was very limited and from pre 2000 era. The interface was dated and buggy. Food quantity was limited with very poor presentation. I had an onward journey of 2 hours with Vistara on a domestic business, and that food quality/presentation was far better than this 14 hr Air India flight. Typical other issues as expected/noted with this flight. Seats were dirty, and you could see adhesive in various places. My seat stopped reclining mid-way and got stuck in a lie-flat position; I was then moved to another seat, which did not recline at all, and I was forced to be in a sitting position for the remainder journey. The washroom sink was choked towards the latter half of the flight. Feedback/complaint registered on Air India website, but as expected, there is no response (been over 15 days). The only positive of the airline was the cabin crew, who were courteous and polite. Flying economy of AC or one of the ME3 is a better choice than flying business with Air India!",no
AirIndia,4,"""I decided to not fly Air India again""",Sridhar Makkena,15th September 2022,"Not Verified |  I was flying from New Delhi to San Francisco. The food was horrible. The chicken was bone dry,  green beans were raw at the center, the dish was very watery. The rice I was served was very dry and hard, the curry lacking any flavor. The seats didn't recline properly, and were as hard as a rock. The cabin crew was helpful, but unfortunately that's about as far as the positives go. I decided to not fly Air India again.",no
AirIndia,3,"""Air India will certainly be my last option""",Alpa Gandhi,15th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed with in flight entertainment. Mine did not work at all and getting through the long flight was a nightmare. The steward clearly told me that they cannot check each every unit and it is just my bad luck! I am already dreading my return flight after 15 days. Will Air India stay on my list of preferred airlines? Answer is no. Air India will certainly be my last option. Also. one of my bags also came back damaged!,no
AirIndia,1,"""not cleaned since many of the past flights""",Akhilesh Joshi,15th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 27 Jun 2022. Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.  The hot tea/coffee was served in paper cups of roadside quality which can be bought in market for Rs 25- 100 pieces.",no
AirIndia,8,"""Overall good flight""",Amit Kumar Sanghi,15th September 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Service quality was excellent. Food was good. Amenity kit is good. Seats were a bit old. Screen Remote was not working. Movie choices are few. Overall good flight.,yes

Staff were courteous, as it was snack time so only a sandwich with a sweet were provided, same for Mumbai Ahmedabad flight as it was less than an hour flight. At Bhubaneshwar after boarding there were some security reasons (and it was independence day of India) we were deboarded and again have to go through security and also through check of aircraft, this made the schedule delayed and we were on the verge of missing our connecting flight, we contacted commercial staff and they assured that they will try our best to get the connection. When we reached Mumbai it was already boarding time of our connection, just after disembarking we saw a staff who was waiting for us , he escorted till security, before security he changed our (only) boarding pass with a new one which was printed on business class so that we can go through business class security which was like a breeze. Actually we were the last one to board and they were waiting for us only.",yes

AirIndia,1,"""It was a nightmare for us""",D Baji,20th August 2022,"Not Verified |  The flight was old and everything in it showed ageing. The plastics were cracked, upholstery stained, cushions rock solid, paint peeling. The entertainment screen was not working and when asked the air hostess replied that it’s complaint in almost half of the flight. This happened on our way to and back. This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi. It was a nightmare for us, especially travelling with a child. What an embarrassment to Indians!",no

I have tried contacting them after that as well to no avail.",no
AirIndia,2,"""I would not recommend this airline""",K Ankur,7th August 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience flying Air India. The plane from Mumbai to Newark was dilapidated and some of the seats were even broken (they were still assigned to customers). The in-flight entertainment did not work. The flight attendants seemed apathetic to pressing the request assistance button on the seats. The food was just OK. We had terrible experience checking in at the Mumbai airport. The airport manager was rude and would not let me check in my car seat for free which is the law in the US and demanded me to pay extra money for it. He would not listen to my argument that I got it to India for free and this was my return trip back to the US. Only later I showed him that the Air India website listed that car seats travel free that he allowed me to check the car seats for free. I would not recommend this airline to anyone till Air India retrains their staff in customer service and upgrades their airplanes.,no
AirIndia,2,"""a dilapidated and outdated aircraft""",S Harmaj,7th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India should be ashamed for operating such a dilapidated and outdated aircraft for a 14-hour flight on this sector and charging a premium of almost CAD $2500.00 per ticket for a one-way flight. Their domestic aircrafts are in much better shape. There was a 8 hour delay to begin with. Paid additional price for booking XL seats for extra leg space but to my horror realized that these seats are narrower at the waist in comparison to a normal seat. Broken tray tables with cracks and stains, no inflight entertainment (for the entire duration of the journey) and a nonworking toilet added to our woes.

AirIndia,1,"""This is the worst airline""",Isha Thakur,7th August 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline. Also the airhostess were very rude. I booked business class tickets. The seats were completely uncomfortable. I had requested for 1 extra blanket for my back and they refused. The staff member said 1 person will get only one and the staff were using 3 blankets to sleep on the seats. Also they had curtains closed in the middle row. The staff occupied all the seats in the middle row to sleep.  How can the staff sleep in customer area. Business class facilities the staff were using. There is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers. Its waste of money. Also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure. When I claimed I didn’t get any compensation. They are rude and worst airline. The staff is very unprofessional.,no
AirIndia,2,"""It was a horror show""",D Meares,7th August 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between. So your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience.",no
AirIndia,7,"""I am severely disappointed""",E Han,9th July 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a window seat, and the person in the middle seat next to me had a broken screen. Nothing was done, so I just told him that I would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie. Midway through the flight, I was really cold, and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants. The call button was not working, so I tried flashing my light from my cell phone, but nobody was minding me. Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out. The good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me. Also, after being served peanuts, the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on; however, the cabin crew was not implementing this. I have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now. I just wish Air India would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously. In addition to this, my seat and table were not exactly very clean (see attached photos). As a Star Alliance Member, I am severely disappointed.",yes

The total journey was roughly 10 hours and surprisingly had a pleasant experience. Likes: Legroom - Had better legroom compared to other airlines - Food - provided food in both the flights which is not an option with most other airlines - Well behaved staff - On time baggage availability - Value for money - Use of minimal plastic cutlery Dislikes - There should have been an entertainment system at least in the international flights.

The mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable .. only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate. We received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid. Flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together, well at least for my friend and I because we're nervous on planes. They were unable to do that for us and we all sat in completely different seats ... when we made a complaint and tried to switch seats they kept dismissing us. I most certainly wouldn't choose to fly with Air India.",no
AirIndia,1,"""relates to my lost luggage""",A Kajay,9th July 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board.",no

After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease.

After challenging it and asking to be rebooked to another flight they said there was nothing they could do. When we showed up at the service counter, they told us that we were late for our flight which simply was not true. The flight was indeed overbooked.

AirIndia,1,"""first and last Air India experience""",Amandeep Singh,21st May 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was very disappointed by bad client service experience from Delhi airport by Air India team. First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs. After that i asked them any help to at least a stay in hotel for waiting time but they said no we can't do anything. For me it's the first and last Air India experience.",no

AirIndia,1,"""only 10% of the screens started working""",Freny Zaveri,21st May 2022,"Not Verified |  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue.",no

We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything). The machine was malfunctioning and so they made all 400 of us stand in line waiting for an hour while they figured out they had to plug it in and we took off late because of it.

AirIndia,1,"""left stranded with very little options""",S Kamalaya,30th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited.",no

I don’t want to mention anything about toilet cleanliness. Food quality was pathetic, quality came down drastically, not at all tasty.",no
AirIndia,1,"""One of the worst experiences""",J Havawin,4th April 2022,✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst experiences of my life in flying. The ground staff was rude and did not know how to handle edge cases. I got sick due to extreme heat and on requesting priority check-in it was provided but the experience is worst than normal check-in. The duty Manager was rude and did not handle it well even on explaining the health condition. The Inflight experience was also not good. Food was stale (Breakfast and Lunch). The flight attendants were also not courteous and did not come to attend to the passenger (me) even 2 hrs after calling. InFlight entertainment was also not working. Seems flight attendants are there for sake of being there not for service. Better go for any other Airline.,no
AirIndia,2,"""nothing seems to have changed under the new ownership""",Sudipto Sarkar,4th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | We recently flew Business Class on London->Delhi->Bagdogra and returned Kolkata->Delhi->London. Except for on-schedule flights, nothing seems to have changed under the new ownership. No entertainment system available and even the flight attendants seemed unaware. Then the lame excuse - ""our entertainment system is getting updated under new ownership"". We didn't even bother to try the entertainment system on any further leg. The Priority tags on the luggage were the biggest jokes, except at Heathrow, almost everywhere, we got our luggage almost at the end. During our return, we had a 4 hours wait at Delhi Intl. terminal and there was no lounge facility available. I would have expected them to have an arrangements with other airlines or providers. I feel, it will take time for Air India to change its archaic and unprofessional model.",no

AirIndia,1,"""Never again Air India in my life""",Joseph Cherian,4th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I entered the Air India aircraft (Boeing 777) there was no fresh smell but a sensation of stale air. During the 15-hour flight, none of the tv screens was working. The announcement was made over the public address system that the tv screens were faulty, for which they apologized.  AC too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy. None of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services.  Throughout the flight, people were walking up and down the aisle to fetch water. For lunch they also included the snack meant for tea, so crew can be spared the trouble of serving again at tea time. The flight was so deplorable that I cancelled my return trip to Vancouver by Air India and booked on Lufthansa instead, even though I had to lose a substantial amount of money. Never again Air India in my life.",no

No web check in from Vancouver as it is not in the drop down list.I called customer service and the poor lady could not help me much. The flight is totally basic. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. The seats are broken and dirty. No reading light or call button. Thankfully I was forewarned so I had downloaded movies for kids on their computers. I had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this I did not get the chosen seats. This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working. The saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves. They commiserated with us as they were not responsible for the poor quality provided by AI. The lady next to me helped me with my frustrated tired kids. On the whole I would not recommend this flight. New management has a huge task ahead of them.,no

The overhead lights and assistance buttons also did not work. When I asked for water, they told me to go to the back and get it myself. The bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper or hand sanitizer. Travellers were not even provided basic toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste even though it was a 16 hour flight.

AirIndia,3,"""most mediocre Business class""",A Sahyra,4th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled in AI 309 Melbourne to New Delhi. It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only. Cost: it was slightly cheaper than other business class when I say slightly 1200AUD less than other flights. And I chose it, which is clearly a mistake. Will not recommend this carrier.",no
AirIndia,1,"""doesn't care in the least about customer service""",C Thane,4th April 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am horrified! I've never been treated so badly in my entire life! I showed up for my flight 3 hours early. When I went to check in, I was asked if I had filled out the Air Suvidha form. I had not, as I had not been notified by Air India that this form was required, and I looked all over their website and found no mention of this form. I have been to India 4 times before and knew to have all my pertinent documents with me, which I did, but nobody told me I had to upload them to a special website. Filling out the form was impossible to do on a cell phone, I couldn't get the documents to be small enough, so the form kept being rejected. There was nobody there helping all the people who had not filled out the form because none of them were notified in advance. There were a half dozen of us that were not permitted to check in because we were unable to complete the form on our cell phones, among those turned away were an elderly couple and a young couple with an infant baby. This is totally unconscionable! The couple with the infant baby asked if they could at least be compensated with a hotel room, and the heartless Air India employee behind the counter said, sorry there is nothing we can do for you. Then to add insult to injury, when trying to rebook the flight, Air India is charging a $300 no show fee. This airline doesn't care in the least about customer service. I will never book a flight with Air India again. Do yourself a favor and book with a different airline.",no

AirIndia,1,"""sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey""",S Shetty,13th March 2022,"Not Verified |  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again.",no

No entertainment on the 16 hrs flight. It felt like I was in a black hole or something like that. I requested the flight attendants to turn the screen on or change the seat if the screen is broken and they responded in humiliating and disrespectful way and did nothing.  If the screen was not working why did you allotted the seat to me, it was very unfair with me.",no

AirIndia,1,"""plane was filthy,  entertainment non existent""",Anisha Judge,13th March 2022,"Not Verified |  I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery.",no

However, I did expect to see changes in the Soft Product like Ground staff, Cabin Crew, Inflight meals and most Importantly the On Time Performance. I was very impressed with the overall time management of the ground staff who ensured on time boarding. The Cabin crew was courteous and ensured that all the pax wore masks for the entire duration of the flight. Air India offers free refreshments or meals on a short 60 Minute flight like this one so I was served a refreshment box with a veg puff, tetra juice pack, Tomato ketchup and and the crew was kind enough to serve me another snack box when I requested.

You have to go the service station, sometime passengers don't know and they wait all the time for drinks. Like me and didn't announce that. For snacks they serve that 10rupees bread cold sandwich and  breakfast quality is ok. When you ask them for these things they give excuse of COVID.

In desperation, I agreed but was told they would only change the flight after I brought the luggage that was checked on the earlier flight. I got my luggage and as expected the counter staff of Air India told me now the change fee had become 7000 rupees.

For every call, the Call center agent verifies the details again and then transfers the call to the ticketing team for booking, cancellations, rescheduling and refunds. But then the call gets disconnected invariably after 30 mins. I faced this same issue when I tried to reschedule my return domestic flight as my original flight was cancelled. Why can we not access the direct line to the ticketing team when are actually choosing that option while calling the call center? I think this is the biggest pain, please fix this.

Had to do so at the time of check in to ensure that the United frequent flyer was printed on the Boarding Pass. Air India should ensure that any Star Alliance number can be inserted into the booking. Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. Smooth flight, great Boeing 777  and great meals! However, after the first 2 hours, the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not re-stocked. Extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew, very helpful to the families with kids and senior citizens. Air India Lounge at Delhi airport with very little supplies and hardly any variety of food. Cramped space during the pandemic. I flew from Delhi to Mumbai after the 14 hour flight from Toronto to Delhi. It was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by Air India non-flying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes. My own business class seat was changed in favor of a Captain's daughter flying on the flight.

AirIndia,1,"""customer support has been absolutely pathetic""",J Kultin,2nd December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Air India on a single-leg domestic flight of less than an hour. Unfortunately Air India lost my luggage on this flight. While I understand that accidents like these happen on any airline, Air India's customer support has been absolutely pathetic ever since. Calls to generic customer support lines that can be found online either don't work or connect to someone who cannot help after waiting for long periods. The specific phone numbers I received to the team handling my case at Goa airport do not answer to my calls or messages (even confirmed that they do answer when called from a different number, so I strongly suspect them of ignoring my specific phone number). At this point it has been almost two weeks since losing my bag, and a week since I last managed to get through to Air India (despite daily attempts to do so). In short this experience with customer service is extremely frustrating, and having to deal with them has made my trip much worse than it had to be without luggage. Apart from not having much confidence in Air India trying to return my luggage to me, my attempts to get compensated for (1) additional expenses made for new clothing and toiletries and (2) for the value of the bag if not found after 21 days has been frustrating as well. I was instructed at the airport to send my receipts to an email address specific to the Goa team, after which my case would get updated with them and I'd retrieve the compensation by picking it up in cash at any global Air India office. Unsurprisingly I have not heard back on this email address after a week, and even if the compensation would have been honored in my case the idea of having to physically go to an office after I leave India is bonkers. In my many desperate attempts to get any sign of life on my case from Air India the only place where they have been sort of responsive is through Twitter, but even they do not seem to be able to get an update from the luggage team actually handling my case. Concluding, I would advise everyone to avoid Air India at all cost as any circumstance in which you'd have to deal with their customer support will be extremely frustrating. While I would expect non-budget national carriers and Star Alliance members offer some basic level of service, this is not at all the case for Air India.",no
AirIndia,1,"""worst experience with this airline""",Lilesh Karade,2nd December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Recently I traveled with Air India and experienced a worst experience with this airline. We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available. I travelled with Indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable. In similar situation at Chandigarh airport when I reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight, they made sure that I boarded in the flight with my family. Their personnel accompanied me from entrance of the airport up to the flight. Now I can understand why this airline is in losses from so many years.

In terms of interior, seats can't be pushed back more than an inch, screens not functioning properly, provided meal was also tasteless. Overall the worst experience. When I asked an attendant to provide water, she said it was kept in the galley, get it from there. Blanket and cushion is not provided in flight. I would be inclined towards zero rating for all criteria.",no
AirIndia,1,"""they were not aware about the rule""",Kartik Panchal,2nd December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am Extremely disappointed with the ground crew staff of Air India at Ahmedabad airport. I was travelling on 12th Nov 2021 from Ahmedabad to Chicago via Delhi. My flight was at 7:35 PM and I was inside airport at 5:30 PM. The Airport ground crew of Air India, stopped me and said we can not travel to USA as my infant child is holding Canadian passport and so she can't travel USA without valid B1/B2 VISA. They didn't even know that Canadian passport holders gets on arrival visa to enter USA. When I showed both of them the proof of USA & Canadian federal website and rules about the same that Canadian passport holders are allowed to travel USA and get on arrival visa. That supervisor told me ""people can write anything in their website, so we don't consider federal website as a proof"" I was shocked knowing they were not aware about the rule. When my travel agent directly contact to higher authorities from Air India and explained that they are wrong, I was issued board passes after 2 hours of harassment by Air India. The aircraft was so dirty and unhygienic to even fly. This was very old aircraft and there was food stuck in side the TV remote and all inside the seat corners. The seats were even damaged and broken joints for food tray.",no

I have to use my own lap to eat the food. I have asked for Non-Veg, as I have already eaten Veg first time - Flight attendant answer - Sorry no options and Veg is the only option. My next seat customer has got the Non-Veg after some heated discussion, still no luck for me.  Seat recliner push-button broken hence can not push back. Flight attendant response - Cant do anything, we will check and sort this in London. Forget about charging ports, as all the USB ports are broken and inhouse media needs to reboot twice to work the Multimedia.

AirIndia,1,"""I never recommend Air India to anyone""",M R Raghunath,2nd December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst experience in my life time. The flight was supposed to be a direct flight from Bangalore to Hyderabad at 6.50pm on 13th Nov 2021. Suddenly a text message on the morning of the 13th that the boarding time is at 03.10pm. It's the first shock, reached airport leaving all my day plans. Later the flight started around 4.00pm. One more shock on the plane is its via Kolhapur. In a very bad mood we reached Kolhapur at 5.40pm, its suppose to leave by 5.50pm, the Kolhapur staff were informed by the airline staff that they have to take off on or before 5.50pm. Again it got delayed and the flight was not started till 6.15pm. Suddenly an announcement that the flight can't take off due to bad weather when we can see the stars and the moon clearly. So many people had connecting flights to travel abroad. They have given back our luggage and not said anything. I waited till 8.30pm with no update, at least on next day timings. Then I left to catch a bus to Hyderabad, couldn't and had to come back to Bangalore. My return from Hyderabad is on 14th Nov 2021 at 08.15pm. I have planned for a day to attend my clients place.

AirIndia,2,"""the most disappointing experience""",N Shah Jenkins,2nd December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had my first experience with Air India recently, and I have to say it has been up there as possibly the most disappointing experience I have ever had. In summary, if you have a choice - please choose another proper airline. This was a flight long haul from London to Bombay. The ticket was booked in economy and upgraded to Business Class using FR miles. Prior to flying I needed to contact customer services and this was a nightmare. I wasted hours of my time trying to call them. I managed to get through to one person, who when I explained the problem just shouted back what’s the problem, what’s the problem. Then he put me on hold and a different man who was more well spoken answered and then lied to me that he was going to arrange a video call back in 2h. Very confusing that he would say that, and not try to help me, and not collect any of my personal details. I never did receive any support and when calling back the telephone queue was like a prank call, with the queue position going up and down like a yo-yo. Shocking, beyond terrible but the worst part is those lies from customer services, that really damages Air India’s credibility with me. Anyway I went to the airport, I was concerned about extra check during COVID times so I arrived 3.5 hours before departure. Air India refused to allow me to check in early, despite the Business Counter being in use by economy passengers. Now I know I was early, so partially my fault. However at one stage other BOM passengers were being allowed to join the economy queue while I had to wait for be allowed to go to the Business Class check-in. By the time I checked in, there was one BOM economy passenger I recognised that reached the counter before me. Business Class is meant to be a premium product to take the hassle and stress out of travelling, or add a little luxury. I travel in economy for personal travel about 99% of the time, as we all have bills to pay. However when I upgrade to business class, I expect to enjoy it and see the benefit. After this ordeal I was able to enjoy at the lounge facilities at London Heathrow, luckily it was a Star Alliance lounge run by another airline, phew! I’m glad it wasn’t an Air India lounge, lest I would be subjected to further torture. At the boarding gate more fun and games I’m afraid. One giant mess of a queue to have temperature readings before going to the boarding desk. This meant there was no discernible difference between economy and business class passengers, just one big line to wait in. More stress and hassle which was supposed to be avoided. On the plane, as expected a tired cabin, outdated infotainment. The seat was comfortable but lacking some adjustment options. The infotainment screen was low resolution, and difficult to use compared with modern equivalents on proper airlines such as Etihad. The Business Class cabin is what you would expect on a shorter haul flight, such as 4-5h, not a 9+h flight. I will write a complaint to Air India. I don’t expect to receive anything back.",no
AirIndia,2,"""Services have downgraded tremendously""",Jyoti Kumari,24th October 2021,✅ Trip Verified | Services have downgraded tremendously. They made all the passengers sit in the flight for about 30-40 mins without switching on the Air Conditioner. When customers asked they did nothing about it. People were using papers to fan themselves. The flight didn’t take off on time or land on time. My seat was also changed post boarding while entering the flight manually without my consent like it was a local train.

We had to attend function and that's why we took early flight so that we reach on time. We missed our function and also lost all our mood to attend function.

One of the most impressive thing about Air India is their 25Kg Luggage allowance. The flight was on time and landed before scheduled arrival time though there was no meal service, the crew distributed water bottles and Safety kits.

Every time, they say it is in process or they have initiated the refund. Finally, on 14th Oct. 2021, I called them again and requested the status. The lady, who picked my call first was so impatient and she forwarded my call to some other department and didn't even wait for me to finish what I was trying to say. The next customer service assistant told me they don't have some number required from the booking agency. Then I asked her why you guys did not tell me this all these days (I must have called them at least 10-15 times, every 2 weeks I used to call).

AirIndia,1,"""most terrible experience ever""",G Palaya,24th October 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst flight ever with the worst ever staff. We booked an air india flight to Goa, but the flight was horrible so was the ground staff as well as the people sitting at the reception. There was an 11 month baby with us. At the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else. But they did not cooperate. The air India website is so so poor. This is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in. I have traveled so many times before, each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasn't the case with this airline. Rather we got the last seat of the airline i.e., the seat near the washroom. It was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us. Again while coming back from GOA the same thing happened. The same seats were allotted. I called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call. After 25 mins one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude. She said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that I tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side. While calling the Air India customer care even if u are in a queue, your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down. The staff was highly rude and no cooperative and it was a terrible experience. The mother with the infant wasnt given any preference for the seat even after requesting them.

My boarding pass was already printed and given to me with the seat I had chosen at booking, but Air India staff subsequently assigned my seat to someone else. On the plane, when I raised the issue, the cabin crew and counter staff failed to rectify the situation. They then moved me to a demonstrably worse seat, one without a TV, which all other passengers had. Mind you, this was for a 15-hour flight. I understand that people sometimes need to have their seats shifted, but surely there were others on the plane who hadn't paid for their seats, so their seats should be changed, not those of us who paid for our seating. In addition, it's outrageous that Air India would give my seat to someone else after I checked in and had the my boarding pass with my proper seat number printed on it.",no

I don't understand then why they are charging more from us, if you don't want to provide us with all amenities. If this was a COVID flight, we expect some cleanliness but there was no hygiene. The air hostesses were so rude sometimes. They didn't allow us to use some restrooms because of their safety concerns. Really! As we are traveling, this doesn't mean that we have COVID.

Even now it shows that the status as confirmed. We went to the airport with all the luggage and all and we came to know that Air India flights are not been flying since more than a month now. So now why are we allowed to book the tickets when the flights are not flying at all. Secondly the systems at Air India Customer care are not at all updated and they have no idea or update of the current status of the flights. We would have called at least 10 times and every time they mentioned flight is confirmed and later after several transfer to escalation team and all we get to know that flights are not flying. Now at maharaja we got the update that the flight is not flying, however it is a scam and trying to fool people as till yesterday in maharaja It was showing out name and details for the particular flight but today is says it is cancelled. Are the website and customer care people not aware of the current status or are they doing it knowingly to collect money from people and not refund it.Its a big scam going on that too when Indian government is involved. Now when we call for refund we are directed to several teams on the call on long waits and no one is able to give a proper solution. Not sure if we will ever get the money back. Really frustrated, along with that we also did the RTPCR test which cost around 600$ for 3 of us. we had given several calls before going for the test just to be sure and conformed and the Customer care guys mentioned it is confirmed. At the Airport we met 4 other families who had booked on the same flight on same date and were facing the same issue.

All of the above happened to me. I booked a business class ticket and tried to cancel online but the system was down so I called to cancel within 24 hours. But the customer support agent casually said, and I quote ""please call back later. The system is undergoing maintenance and I cannot cancel at this time"". That was my first red flag. What kind of an agent cannot cancel even if the user cannot cancel? So I left an email asking them to cancel within 24 hours. I called several times after that and I got the same response:  I'd have to pay the $200 cancellation charge because the 24 hours has passed. Otherwise, they said its wise to hold off on cancelling until my escalated case would be reviewed by someone at a higher level. That the customer agents do not have access to emails because they just dont and only the backend team can see my emails That I'd get a response within 24 to 48 hours (but didnt). Even if I did, it was always automated or tightly scripted (was I ever talking to a human?). Exhausted with the constant back and forth and going nowhere for 1 month but before my flight date, I called them to cancel my booking, agreeing to pay the $200. I was promised that my escalated case would be seen to and I'd get back my $200 fee but it never was.

No inflight entertainment, seats were broken. Food was the only plus which made the journey bearable. Overall- very disappointed, and it seemed from their lacklustre service that Air India just doesn't care. No improvement during the return leg of the journey from Del-Fra.

Cabin crews were good to help. The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working. Touch screens are hardly working. On the second leg (Delhi to Kolkata), it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainment/internet service.

AirIndia,4,"""the product is really sub par""",R Pardolan,17th June 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  After avoiding Air India for years, I was forced to spend my hard earned money on them for a round trip between IAD and MAA because of the Indian government forbidding sixth freedom traffic under the covid air bubble agreements. I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels.",no

I don’t Mind giving the amount if it’s the rule and is legit. The desk person let go a girl without even weighing her carry on telling her, why do you want to weigh it, if you can lift it, that means it’s not that’s heavy, and the same guy charged me around Rs 600 per kg.

Not following protocols or any rules. I was flying from Cochin to Delhi then to Toronto in a Air India connection flight. The Air India staff from Delhi did not let me fly even when I had a valid PCR report with me. They were so rude and they stopped me from boarding telling that they need to verify my result. The supervisor at the Delhi Airport was being so irresponsible and later was not clearly saying anything about why I'm not eligible to travel. Then he later apologized and told me he will book one ticket for me the next day.  I stayed there from 1 am in the morning to 11 am talking to everyone in Air India asking about this issue. No one responded in a good way and even was laughing at me. The supervisors are even worse with no responsibility. They even took back my boarding pass from Delhi to Toronto to take away the proof.

Also when doing the web check in, I was also surprised to see that the system was unable to recognize the PNR which was quite strange, however the mobile check in was successful and even though the timing of the flight was uncertain, just 1 day before the departure, the airline provided a confirmation of the flight timings via SMS. The baggage drop and ground process was quick and smooth. Boarding was on schedule and the departure was also slightly delayed by 15 mins due to the air show in Bangalore. However the crew made up for the time en-route. The airline has also resumed full meal service and lunch was provided which was a welcome addition. The meal was good and nice and we landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule which was good. The web check in experience could have been better and also the rescheduling was not exactly welcome but the inflight experience was quite nice and the crew was very good in looking after the passengers.

However on the day the flight which was suppose to take off at 8:30 and reach Bengaluru by max 3pm on the same day took off at 11 from Assam which is understandable because it can get quite foggy during winter. But after reaching Kolkata there was no information or any message from the airline regarding the delayed flight to Bengaluru. My dad has a chronic kidney disease and its difficult to travel for long hour and moreover they are not frequent flyers. Not even a single staff from air India passed any kind of information and on enquiry they simply raised their eyebrow with that arrogant attitude. I wonder what they are so proud of I just wish i had their names. The airline completely forgot their customer. Such a terrible airline. There is more to it, so the flight was delayed from Kolkata to Bengaluru via Hyderabad again by LEGIT 11hr which was also unsure of.

Completely disgusted with my experience. After a year of chasing Air India for a refund due to a flight that they cancelled, I have yet to receive a single cent. I did not even find out about the cancellation until after I arrived to the airport and was informed at the check in counter. Apparently they tried to call me once and I didn't pick up. No email notification, nor text...nothing. Several emails went by without a response. For months I waited, repeatedly calling customer service, until I received an email saying they would only issue a refund when things returned ""to normalcy."" Now it has been 12 months. Half of the time you call their number, you will get a message saying it's the wrong number. The other half of the time it won't go through at all. When you finally reach them, you receive service from staff so incompetent it's obvious they were not even given basic training of how to look up information in their system. You feel sorry for them as they fumble around. I won't even blame the call center staff, as it's obvious the responsibility lies on the complete negligence of the Air India management to run an efficient operation. Why are airlines allowed to get away with this behavior? Any other business would have been shut down a long time ago.

While asking the reason for that they were silent. As per my knowledge one baggage is allowed per person so how come all the space is full? No explanation at all.

The uncomfortable seats and subpar food were shocking, especially for a long-haul flight. The meal service was particularly disappointing, with poha being served on a 5-6 hour flight.

We reached Dammam airport at 9 00 pm & after standing in queue for 45 mins were informed about a delay & check in did not begin till 11 pm. The worst part is that we faced the same issue on our return flight. The crew was unapologetic about the delay & instead of offering in flight services at 11 30 pm as per the original schedule, passengers were rudely woken up for inflight services at 1 30 am. Waiting at the airport from 6 30 pm for a 10 30 am flight is alright but our flight was delayed so much that we only taxied out of Bombay at 1230 am & everyone was exhausted. It seems to be that these delays were planned & timed to leave 2 hours later on purpose by the airlines to save time or money or both without any consideration for the inconvenience caused to 100s of tired passengers, families & children.",no

IndiGo,5,"""unacceptable and very poor service""",S Comar,23rd September 2024,"Not Verified |  India is very poor in customer service. There is barely any concept of good professional customer service. They don’t care about customer loyalty. This is even more evident with airlines as there is very little competition in the domestic sector that is now basically a duopoly between Indigo and Air India. I have had heaps of bad experiences with Air India and had to forego many flights when they change schedule. When they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money. I preferred Indigo as I found the service good and had no problems until recently. I had booked return flights IXC-JDH in early July to fly in late August. A week ago on checking my bookings on their app I found they had changed my inbound flight from JDH to IXC from a layover in JAI to DEL. No issue with that. However there was no message or email from the airline of the change. I just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app. Not only that, the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours. Had I not checked I would have missed my flight. As the new time was not suitable to me I called the airline. I was able to change to a later time. However I was told I must pay a change fee of INR 2000 per ticket. You change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it? I explained to the agent that this is an Involuntary change and I must not have to pay for it. The agent put me on hold to get an authorisation. I was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge. In such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation. They should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end. Now after a week, I find out they have once again made a schedule change. They have now moved my flight from JDH to 1450 from 1025. I will arrive in DEL at 1625. However they have not amended my connecting flight DEL-IXC. That is scheduled at 1505, which will land in IXC before I even arrive in DEL. So I am back on the phone to Indigo. I requested them to put me on their DEL-IXC flt at 1725. Once again they are unable to do that. Was advised they will check and call me back. Got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight. They want me to take a 5 hour layover in Delhi and arrive in IXC at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours. I once again pleaded my case. Was told they will check call me again. Again refused, obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport. No empathy at all. There is no recourse, either take it or leave it. I find this totally unacceptable and very poor service.",no
IndiGo,2,"""struggled due to online payment""",Manin Kulkarni,10th August 2024,"Not Verified |  Indigo treated my son in humanly at Hyderabad Airport, who was travelling first time alone as a student. Following things happened at Airport of Hyderabad.  Check in staff charged excess luggage fee which my son was willing to pay, but he struggled due to online payment. The staff removed him from the queue twice and every time made him come in queue.  They happily allowed him to throw his study books in dustbin. No courtesy was shown or effort made to talk to parents. We were online but airline staff did not task to us or help us. They made him go to empty desk and wait and then a staff came. She told, your flight luggage time is closed. You can throw luggage here and board alone. The delay was done by staff by making him queue twice and then denied boarding. He wasnt guided properly to rebook the flight. My son was struggling with bags and there was no human touch to support him. He managed to rebook the flight just to know that all previous ticket features like extra luggage and food were stripped down. They finally took him in next flight with extra luggage cost. I dont have issue paying thrice the price to airline, but really disappointed how they treated a student flying first time. Allowed him to throw books. No guidance. This was small amount which as parents we could have paid to staff or someone to help student. God knows what they will do with elderly.",no
IndiGo,1,"""quite disappointing""",Pooja Deshpande,10th August 2024,"Not Verified |  My experience from Bangkok to Bangalore, was quite disappointing. They no longer provide fragile stickers, which is concerning for passengers with fragile items in their luggage. Additionally, considering it's an international flight, the basic fare does not include any complimentary meals or drinks. Even water is not provided unless specifically requested. The in-flight services are also overpriced, with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees. Furthermore, there are no pillows or blankets provided, making the presence of five or six cabin crew members seem unnecessary if they are not providing any services.

IndiGo,1,"""Ground Service of IndiGo is the worst""",N Hasani,10th August 2024,✅ Trip Verified |   The Ground Service of IndiGo is the worst. The 2 ladies of Cochin ground service was beyond rude and disrespectful and charged me 1000 extra for a luggage that was below the allowed amount under student discount. Their claim was that it was in 2 baggages instead of a single one. I am a frequent flyer and this has never occurred in any of the airports before including Cochin for the same type of services.

The schedule of this flight is very unconfortable, making us impossible to have a hotel breakfast before boarding. We had 1 hour delay and not a single cabin announcement to explain it. The captain was unable to make any announcement except a brief incomprehensible announcement just before landing. The onboard entertainment was not working and we had to make the whole journey with a white screen, without any idea of the time and our position. The stewardesses distributed water generously, but instead of a meal, I received only a tiny portion of vegetable curry. I was so hungry that I had to rush into a turkish restaurant at the Istanbul airport. The stewardesses are nice, but they still wear the ridiculous ""Girl power"" badge.

IndiGo,2,“Staff is inconsiderate and inhuman”,T Sanderson,10th August 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | Indigo airlines are unreasonably inflexible. They value nonsense rules over humanity it seems. We were flying to Lucknow to visit Ayodhya. The reason we booked this flight was that it was a direct 2 hour flight and my parents are old and I did not want to get a longer itinerary with multiple flights. The flight was at 6:45AM. We reached airport at 5:30Am. I just stood in the long queue as it was the only counter that was working there. Later I found that it was for bag drop only. When asking about check-in counter they asked to check in at kiosk. When I reached there, it said check-in window is closed and that was actually very tight I ran to the only counter for all time assistance and it was queue there also. They asked me to go to supervisor Vismaya. Inspite of sharing my concern with her that our trip is a very short one and we need to reach there soon, she just did a formal call to manager who said it is not possible to check in now. My parents flight was already checked in and mine which was separate had some issues checking in one day prior when I tried. They said that your parents can board but not myself. I made humble request to consider our situation. She kept on saying we understand but we cannot help it. She booked another flight and charged extra 2500 INR per person even when the new flight was having several vacant seats. The new itinerary was long and had multiple flights. The second flight was delayed by an hour and they changed gates at the end moment and we were all tired standing up where there was no formal seating arrangement. The staff there also kept on reprimanding people to be standing in like be where there was no queue absolutely. He was just standing there and targeting people unnecessarily. There were heated arguments there also with other passengers and the staff. The airline is absolutely horrible. Staff is inconsiderate and inhuman as I found.

The flight was 40 minutes delayed later but still they forced us to pay for another. Adding to the frustration was the absence of announcements regarding boarding procedures.  To make matters worse, when I opted to pay for a subsequent flight, I observed a stark contrast in the boarding procedure - I witnessed passengers being allowed to board just five minutes before departure.

This service used to ensure that the passengers purchasing fast forward will get their bag first after de-boarding the plane. So I used to get fast forward because it was convenient. Having travelled today, at the check in counter, the staff tells me that there is no baggage advantage and I will get priority boarding. Something their ""fast forward"" service used to marketed for and now it serves no purpose. Indigo absolutely rips people off for extra money and doesn't provide any service that they promise to offer.",no

IndiGo,1,“Their cheap fare is not worth it”,G Pea,5th March 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | I thought I've seen the worst but this is even worse, the worst airline experience I've ever had. No food or on board entertainment whwatsoever during the long fllights to and from my transit in New Delhi from Singapore with Istanbul as final destination. I'm fine with that but the on ground experience has been terrible. At the gate I was told to go to desk for document check and asked to show visa to my final destination which is after Istanbul and has NOTHING to do with my flight with Indigo. And worst of all I lost my checked in luggage once I arrived in Istanbul. That has never happened in all my 25 years of frequent travel. All of those reviews you've seen about lost luggage & bad customer service with Indigo are completely true. Their cheap fare is not worth it. I regretted not checking Indigo's reviews before taking this airline for the first time on this flight. Looking back I would rather just pay more than taking the bait of cheap fare from Indigo. Avoid it.",no

IndiGo,2,“Crew very nervous and chaotic”,Ira Nagel,5th March 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | I used to love flying Indigo for domestic flights in India but this long haul codeshare flight with TK was really disappointing. It is a too big difference with Turkish Airlines. Only a one time service on a flight duration of 7,5 hours on the leg Delhi-Istanbul, which is already extremely long. The second drink was only served to half of the people and then the crew disappeared. I was only able to get a coffee by a crew call. The third round was chargeable. What a poor service. Crew very nervous and chaotic. Very very Indian English, hardly understandable. Tiny seats, not even space for arms and shoulders. No Inflight Entertainment.

IndiGo,2,“One of worst flight operators”,Shashi Singh,5th March 2024,"Not Verified | One of worst flight operators. They delay flight just 1-3 hours before schedule depature. Once the fight is near delayed departure time, they will delay it further. They are highly unprofessional and money minded and don't care for any customer. People also don't have options as they are the biggest domestic operators. They shamelessly make money from every thing in flight. You pay for boarding, seats, meals.

Out of luck I noticed some days later that the booking was not finalised and the money were returned to my account. They never contacted me via email about this.

After 3 hours and 6 different employees I finally got a ridiculous pink copy of a handwritten report - like 50 years ago. In my hotel I wasted 2 hours trying to chat with them to find out if my loss has been registered - and jumped from position 550 to 26, then back to 3xx, back and forth, meaningless. After calling them a robot's voice sounded like a scifi-movie from the 50s, useless again. So far Indigo acts inhuman, without any empathy for my loss. They do not care.

IndiGo,1,IndiGo customer review,Tangirala Reddy,17th January 2024,Not Verified | I was not even given water after repeated requests and was finally told that I have to pay.

IndiGo,1,“have 0 standards to fly International”,Chirag Acharya,17th January 2024,"Not Verified | One thing is clear. Indigo have 0 standards to fly International. They are not capable enough. My in laws were travelling from Ahmedabad to Abu Dhabi. 5 days before the flight the itinerary changed to Ahmedabad to Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. Even though they were senior citizens, we didn't have any choice but to accept the revised itinerary. They reached Ahmedabad airport. Checked in. Got the boarding pass and boom. 1 hour before the flight they confirmed they don't have a plane to transport them from Ahmedabad to Mumbai. With google algorithms I understood the Raipur Ahmedabad flight created delay for Ahmedabad Mumbai domestic. But they didn't have any other backup. This had happened several times with me & I have stopped booking Indigo for my international destinations. My father in law called up the customer care they said, ""Sir aaj flight cancelled he. Aap ghar jaiye."" (Sir today's flight has been cancelled. Please go home.) Ghar jaiye???? (I have a recording) Is this a Jantanagri express that got cancelled? He fought with the customer care guy & then they offered next day flight of Ahmedabad to Delhi to Dubai. I had to take a leave from office & travel to Dubai to pick them up. Also they didn't give any hotel or food till 11.59 pm. After 12.00 am they gave lounge access & some food. They were at airport since previous day 5 pm. Till 12.00 am nothing was given. They said your flight is scheduled next day at 4.00 am so we can't give food & lounge today. Seriously? I would recommend people around the world even if you are getting 99% off from Indigo don't travel unless time isn't money for you.

As me and my friend was so hungry so we expected food to come fast but they took time may be some technical issue. So when they bring food and said its paid, we are so heart broken that we gave almost 82000 rupees for the tickets and they are still asking for money to give a single sandwich or juice or you can say just a small meal?

The staff seemed overwhelmed, and there was a noticeable lack of urgency in resolving the issue. While I understand that mishaps can occur, the delay in locating and delivering my luggage was frustrating.

IndiGo,6,"""Overall a no-fuss experience""",S Shetty,30th November 2023,"Not Verified |  The flight was just about alright for the 2 hour hop between Delhi and Mumbai. IndiGo has introduced automated baggage drop but the instructions etc are not very clear so most end up needing assistance. Delhi's Terminal 1 is undergoing significant modification and hence the on-ground experience is not very good, with chaotic security lines and limited food options and charging stations. The in-flight experience was courteous but clinical, a typical LCC experience. The legroom was adequate and being an Airbus, the seat width is better but the slim seats are not very supportive and I would hate to be in them for anything longer than a 2 hour journey. The crew do offer free water on the flight on request and in a small glass but only after the pre-booked meals are handed over which on a hot day can be awful. Remember to carry a water bottle since in flight water bottle cost The absence of chargers, app based IFE will be felt on longer journeys. Overall a no-fuss experience but worth it only if you are saving at least 1000-1500 over full fare carriers like Vistara/Air India on the Bom-Del leg, other wise the cost of food at the airport or on-ground will mean the net savings are nil.

Pretty costly ones due to the urgency to fly. Turkish has very old planes running with neanderthal entertainment systems. From Istanbul the night mare started with Indigo. - On a 7 hour flight just one very small meal and a pretty bad one (uncooked thick parathas, practically they could have given us the wheat flour instead). - No beverage options other than coca cola and water. - Neither coffee or tea was served - No entertainment system - Tried changing return flights but couldn't due to the exorbitant prices asked by Turkish to do so. So suffered the ordeal again while flying back where had fellow passengers complaining regrading the same. The boarding experience was unpleasant as they were really unorganised during the zone call. Being miser or cheap is entirely different from being a low cost Airlines. Indigo should fly cattle instead as Cattle won't complain.

During our check-in at HYD, IndiGo's system was down, leading to 7 out of our 13 total checked-in bags being manually tagged. Though we understood that technical issues can happen, what followed was a series of missteps. Upon arrival at DFW, we discovered that all 7 manually tagged bags were missing. The Qatar Airways team at DFW had no information about these manually generated tags, leaving us stranded without vital belongings. We called IndiGo's customer care 9 times over three days, and each time, the response was the same: unable to reach the Hyderabad crew, and no managers on the call center floor to escalate our issue. The lack of responsiveness and the inability to locate our bags with crucial manual tags felt like a major oversight. What added to our frustration was that 5 of the 7 manual tags were taken back by the IndiGo team when their system came back online, leaving us without any physical proof. Polite customer care representatives, though unable to assist. Failure in handling manual tag situation during system downtime.

I asked to see the cabin supervisor and was told she was busy eating. I explained the situation to another crew member and they cautioned the Pax on seat 5D (the mother of the child) to be more decent. Finally after the third call, the family themselves moved the child to seat 4B the middle seat on the other side. At this phase of flight the captain had flashed the fasten seat belt as there was turbulence. To my shock the father of the child sat on 5C made the child stand up on the tray table of seat 4b and play with the overhead fittings including the light, the call button, the oxygen mask compartment and others. I am astonished that such risky and terrible behaviour from the parents of the child was tolerated by the crew and also that the leading lady as they are called simply refused to attend the issue.

I consumed it immediately as the flight took off. By the time, we achieved the flight Service altitude, Ms. Roshani again checked with me on my comfort & also offered further help by providing the breakfast which was not ordered at the time of ticket booking.  What a helping hand by Ms. Roshani, Hats off to her presence of mind & promptness of the service offered. On landing at Pune, Ms. Roshani ensured that I am absolutely on my own & wished me a great stay at Pune. In short, Ms. Roshani & IndiGo Team saved me & a ""would-be"" inconvenience to co-passengers by extending the swift helping hand to me & ensured that I am safe & healthy.  Rest assured on my being an IndiGo fan for rest of my life.",yes

In Mumbai, the ground crew told me my name was not in the list and they cannot provide me wheelchair. The inflight food was inadequate, a bun was given, but without butter. When asked, the hostess told we don't provide butter.  Though there was plenty of time to descend and the seat belt sign was turned off, the crew would not allow usage of the restroom.",no
IndiGo,3,"""airline used to be good""",R Kumar,8th July 2023,"Not Verified | This airline used to be good. However, they have degrading in most of the aspects. Customer experience has taken a nose dive. Recently, I have booked flight from Bangalore to Chandigarh. That got cancelled. Post that I booked a flight to Delhi and have made alternate arrangements to reach Chandigarh. But alas! They rescheduled it again by another hour. This resulted in the snowball effect and my plan which was already impacted due to earlier cancellation. Got impacted again. When I tried to explain this to staff on ground, they could not care less. Such a sad turn of events for an airline which was most trusted.",no
IndiGo,1,"""had the most frustrating experience""",D Rao,8th July 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had the most frustrating experience with IndiGo recently, I was flying from Vadodara to Mumbai, and later in the evening connecting on an international flight to the US. While I was aware that I was allowed only one bag, when I checked in with two bags, the counter staff calculated additional charges for Rs. 12,000! Please note that this is more than the charge for a round-trip ticket between Vadodara and Mumbai! I urged the staff, including the manager on duty, to reconsider as this made no sense, I even offered to buy them a round-trip ticket just to drop my extra bag off in Mumbai and return to Vadodara! While the ground staff was very courteous, I believe the airline's pricing strategy is blatantly skewed towards fleecing international travelers. On one hand IndiGo makes history by placing the single largest order of aircrafts at the Paris Air Show (which as a person of Indian origin, I am proud of), and, literally a week later I get to experience first hand how they plan to make money by fleecing the Indian diaspora on extra baggage fees!",no

IndiGo,8,"""comparatively better than others""",HP Naz,8th July 2023,"Not Verified | Indigo is comparatively better than any other airline I've ever travelled in India. Usually in Indian aircraft that travel to and from the Middle East, the flight attendants' service is quite bad. Here, though Indigo is a budget airline, the service is similar to that of a premium airline. The only thing they can improve is that, usually in Middle Eastern flights which travel to Kerala, they give announcements in Arabic, English and Malayalam but in Indigo and other Indian aircrafts, they give the announcement in English and Hindi. I feel that in an aircraft flying to Kerala, announcements in Hindi are useless since none of us Malayalee know proper Hindi. We can just understand it from here and there.",yes
IndiGo,1,"""like a road way bus""",K Sharma,8th July 2023,✅ Trip Verified | IndiGo airlines are just like a road way bus. One can say like a khatara bus. So much of noise while take off.

I had booked wheelchair assistance and it was mentioned that the wheelchair assistance was in waiting list. When they reached the airport it was mentioned no wheel chair assistance would be provided. They reached the airport close to 3 hrs in advance. The front desk did not even help with other paid assistance wheelchairs. They simply ignored my sister's requests. Departure was at gate 85, later it was changed to Gate 35 at last minute Again my mother had to walk such long distance without any assistance from the airline crew.

IndiGo,5,"""probably India’s best low cost airline""",Shaun Tully,24th April 2023,Not Verified |  IndiGo are a low cost airline and as such are prone to delays. This flight left 40 mins late. Being only an ATR we couldn’t climb above the clouds making it a fairly uncomfortable flight. It’s a pay service although they do give you a free small bottle of water which strangely was handed out as we got off. Seats don’t recline. IndiGo style themselves as a funky airline and so their crew were badges with phrases such as leading lady or Miss IndiGo. I would use them again as I think they are probably India’s best low cost airline.,yes

I bought 2 tickets, one normal and one flexible through flight network and I had a work emergency. I cancelled my flight 3 weeks prior, according to their website they charge 400INR for cancellation when cancelled up to 4 days before the flight. I started the cancellation with flight network and it was immediately bad as they told me my flexible ticket didn't work on cancellation although I found a different information on the website (in some places it says it doesn't work, in others says it works), I emailed IndiGo and they told me my ticket was not flexible (I paid for flexi), anyway, after dozens of emails complaining, I decided to cancel anyway and pay the fee. No refund was processed. I asked to talk to someone in the complaints department, no refund the was processed so I emailed them again. I added attachments of all my conversations with the company and flight network, and they replied saying they would refund me. No refund was done so I emailed them again and received a ridiculous email they would refund me with no-show ammount (10% of my payment) which is unacceptable.

If not confirmed in 20 minutes I should make another payment on the booking PNR or if payment is confirmed and no booking confirmed, I need to wait one week for my money to be returned. Both my US banks flagged Indigo transactions as fraud. To make things worse, none of the five booking or payment processor representatives demonstrated they understand what PNR or airline's standard rules are. The phone systems were so bad that I was disconnected over 4 times and every representative had connection and audio issues. Now day three and 6 hours into a booking process where my Chase account has pre approved my payment, the last rep I worked with asked me to wait one hour for a call back because Indigo's payment systems were offline.",no

We had spent a huge amount to book these two flights. And now I’m going to miss my flight to Trivandrum. And the cabin crew is telling the flight will reach there at 7.15pm.

The flights have no onboard entertainment and food and drinks are payable by cash or credit card, if you pay cash, they only accept rupee notes. If you pay by credit card you have to comply with compulsory 'dynamic currency conversion', which means that the airline will charge you in your home currency (instead of in rupees). On arriving at Kolkata, we were informed that our luggage had been detailed at the origin because security checks had found a power battery pack (these cannot checked in) in the suitcase.

When we arrived at T1 our boarding passes did not allow us entry, by security. We were told to go to the Indigo desk, who informed us we needed to go to T3 for our flight! About 10 of us all protested and asked them to recheck. After checking, they realised they had made a mistake. They issued new boarding passes and managed to give them to the wrong passengers and luckily we sorted it out amongst ourselves. Their check in and transfers at Goa and Delhi were so chaotic.",no

Unfortunately for some reason Indigo flight was delayed AS ALWAYS. The flight was supposed to fly 10:20 PM but it took off by 11:05 PM. Even thought the flight took off so late, the airline must cover up the time gap to reach Mumbai airport on time but in this case they didn't make an effort to do so. We reached extremely late at Mumbai International airport that the check-in counter was closed for my next connecting flight (Cathay Pacific) from Mumbai to Vancouver. Immediately we had to book another flight from Lufthansa and spend CAD 4500. This is extremely disappointing and we would not prefer to travel with Indigo Airlines ever again.",no

Nothing special to be highlighted in this gesture. The journey from DOH to HYD, concerns starts with Boarding until Landing. So, let's jump into facts. Boarding: All International Airlines across the globe board senior citizens, passengers on wheelchairs, and parents with kids first. For ""Indigo"" Airlines, this is not the case will ""dump"" people onto the Bus and transport them from Gate to the Aircraft. In-Flight: Seating is congested, just like Auto-Rickshaw. The cabin crew is courteous and helpful. Landing: 30 Minutes late from their scheduled arrival. As a result, we had to spend another 30 Minutes at the HYD Airport for Immigration Officers' shift rotation. Overall DOH-HYD Experience is just a dump yard ride for me in Indigo Airlines. The journey from HYD to DOH, concerns starts with Check-In until the Landing. Nonetheless, this part of the journey is the most ""Interesting"" part of this review, don't miss it. Check-In: I cannot reiterate my Boarding comment mentioned above, but this Indigo airline is adverse in implementing standards of the International Flight code. Reached the Airport 4 hours before departure, Kids in arms and eight bags to check-in (opted porter service), had to stay in line for 1 hour 25 minutes to approach the check-in counter after repeated requests to follow the check-in code. Finally, at the check-in counter, the indigo staff was inclined to charge me 15k INR extra as my three bags had 1 kg extra and other bags had less than 23 kg allowed. Perpetuating their Code-Share Policy is per bag and not Total Baggage Allowance. Another 30 minutes delayed to clean up the mess they created with bags and complete the Check-In process. Boarding: Reached the Boarding gate running upon completion of Immigration and Security clearance. Boarding will start in 30 minutes. (Boarding Feedback is the same as above). The flight missed the departure time by 27 minutes and arrived at DOH 36 minutes late. As a result, complete baggage from the Indigo flight passengers onboard couldn't board into DOH-IAD Flight.

At least some of the lower service staff tried to be helpful, but the manager of the Bangalore Indigo crew  was the most unhelpful, rude, entitled person I have ever had the misfortune of meeting.

IndiGo,1,"""management should be truly be ashamed""",M Keele,11th December 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  So, I tried to heed the many warnings that I saw in this airline's terrible reviews regarding their baggage “Scam” policy. I recently had a flight from Mumbai to Maldives, for which the ticket fare was $159 for a one-way ticket. Still a little pricey, but not bad. The only reason why I took this airline was because it was the only airline available that had a direct flight to the Maldives. After booking the ticket, I noticed right away that it said only 20 kilo bag allowance. My initial thought was that it was a low weight for an international flight, but I'm sure I can purchase a bag, just in case. The week of the flight, I spent quite a bit of time looking through the baggage options. One problem is that the website will not allow you to add a bag until 48 hours before the flight, which is incredibly inconvenient when you are traveling. At 48 hours, I started the attempt to add a bag. The website is not user-friendly when it comes to adding bags. When you click on the add bags button, it takes you to another screen which then has two more buttons for add to cart or purchase now. Neither of these buttons work. I tried on Safari, Chrome, and also my mobile. Nada. The day before the flight, I spent well over an hour trying to figure out how to do it. On my mobile, I was able to get a little closer to where it would add excess weight, but only 5 kilos. You click on that button and the screen goes blank. Long story short, I had to spend an enormous amount of time on my holiday trying to add a dang bag. I finally found the loophole. When you go to 6e add-ons (where the add baggage should be but isn't) and just click on anything that is listed. It will take you to the add-on page and then there it is. Add a bag. More confusion sets in, because it says add an additional bag for 1800 rupees (~$22 usd). I thought, perfect! One catch, I didn't see anywhere that says what the additional weight is of that bag like you do on ALL the other airline websites out there. The morning of the flight, I saw my bags were still a little too heavy, so I added an extra 5 kilos, which was $40 for just 5 kilos. Yes, $40 for just 5 kilos. I get to the airport and my two bags were 35 kilos. Guy said that my bags were too heavy. I was so confused. I tried what I could to avoid a nightmare and yet it happened anyway. Come to find out, you are allowed 2 bags of 20 kilos TOTAL. Doesn't say total on the website. So, you have to pay $22 extra for the same exact weight, but for an additional bag! What the ever living. That makes no sense. You pay extra for a bag, but actually get less weight, because the additional bag will also add weight, so you have to pack less items. What a disaster. I ended up having to pay $162 in baggage fees for my $159 flight. How the government allows this, I have no clue. I saw a review where someone mentioned highway robbery. Good description, but more like extortion. I also notice that it tends to happen more to foreigners traveling. You have been warned, DO NOT use this airline. Hopefully one day, a reputable airline like Vistara (which was great) will buy this company out and change things around for the good, because the current management should be truly be ashamed. And if anyone asks about the plane size and baggage weight, it was a normal size plane, probably more to the larger size. There is only one reason for these kinds of prices and it is GREED.

The announcement to buy food and beverages online was made but no crew came and asked if we would like to buy anything. When I called them to ask for a tin of cookies for my son, the 1st time I was told they need to serve pre booked meals 1st and then only they will get back to me, and the 2nd time again I asked while collecting trash and they said give us 5 minutes. So basically only pre booked meals passengers were given priority while those even though willing to buy in the air were not even asked if they wanted water. The crew just moved past my row and I had to call her back to ask for the cookies. If this is the kind of service offered, it's better IndiGo clearly states that only pre booked meals will be given any priority. Why make the false announcements of you may purchase any snacks you wish to. I would rate this kind of service negative. Very very disappointed.",no

The boarding pass did not show the gate and the tv screens in the airport didnt show the gate until 5:00 am. We got to the gate at 5:15 and they said go to another counter quickly, from there they said quickly follow Indigo employee assuming he is trying to get us on the flight, instead he stamps the tickets and walk us out to the ticket counter. We waited an hour with 50-60 other people who missed their flight. When we got to the counter they said the next flight is not until tomorrow and its and additional 5000 rs for the tickets.

IndiGo,1,"""careless with sensitive luggage""",S Wayamandi,19th September 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Indigo was utterly careless in handing a sensitive item like infant / baby child restraint system (CRS) and caused damage even after we safely handed it to them at the gate.  The bag is badly torn and the car seat inside scratched when we received it at the destination. The bag which holds the car seat was expensive too and was not a flimsy one which would have gotten easily torn unless it was handled badly. We use the bag for the car seat exclusively for checking the car seat while flying and have been in 6 flights so far without any issues.  It is clear that the seat and bag were subjected to a lot of stress and abrasion and we will forever be doubting the structural integrity of the car seat which is worth over 75k INR due to Indigo's shoddy handling. We made Indigo aware of this issue after we got down and collected the item at VTZ. Without trying to understand the extent of the damage, Indigo's agent blindly offered 500 rupees. We did not accept since just the bag alone costs 10 times that amount. She also tried to push blame on us that the bag was not strong enough to handle air travel. It is appalling that Indigo thinks this is normal handling for a car seat in their business. We left the airport since we disagreed with her 500 rupees offer and did not know what else to do. Agent used our lack of knowledge and did not mention that the correct process is for us file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) with her and use the PIR to later submit a claim to Indigo later. We later found out that leaving the airport without PIR means that we accepted everything was in good condition and cannot hold Indigo liable anymore. Indigo was careless with sensitive luggage items like a car seat and did not offer a fair resolution even after they were made aware.",no

I am a foreigner and I booked the flight at least two months in advance. In these 2 months I received several unsolicited emails for buying extra services (like many airlines do). To days before my flight, when I was in India, I received an email informing that it was time to proceed with web check-in. I did so, but my web check-in failed with with message saying that I was I the ""watch queue"". I contacted the help desk, which was not very quick, but in the meanwhile I browsed the internet and found out that, since I booked my flight with an international credit card I needed to show the credit card at the check-in. Luckily enough, I brought the credit card with me (it was about to expire, and I have more than one credit card, so I really thought I could leave it at home) otherwise they would have denied boarding.  I have no idea why they needed to check my credit card (they didn't explain), and no idea why they didn't send me any email telling me that I needed to show my credit card.

Boarding started on time and the crew were able to discharge their duties well. For the corporate meal, I was pleased to note that the selection had increased from the last time and also included items like chicken noodles and biriyani along with tea, coffee, juices. The portions of the food were okay. The flight landed on time and the crew did not manage to wish goodbye and thank others but did wish me when I passed by which was appreciated.

And then the wait started, at first they said some technical error we should be go to fly soon. But then it was delayed by almost four hours. People where seated in the aircraft with no air condition / no water to drink. The air hostess were helpless. The main reason for the delay was because the pilot who was supposed to fly this aircraft didn't turn up for some reason.

However, my recent experience was a fantabulous one and I need to appreciate two women, who made this journey a happy one. Joyce - Based at the Indigo counters in Hyderabad, automatically upgraded my seat from 4C to 1C, seeing that I am a tall man and would have issues in the back seats.

IndiGo,4,"""don't expect any support""",Stephanie Preyer,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  I originally intended to give IndiGo a good revues, as I've been travelling India for 2 months and their service was fine for the most part. However, in the last week the airline has had 2 major mishaps which have completely unravelled my travels and I felt compelled to warn other travellers. Firstly, they didn't inform travellers that Nepal requires an exit PCR test in order to leave the country. Of course, you could argue that it's up to the traveller to check requirements but all the all focus is always on entry requirements for the destination country. I've travelled throughout covid and Nepal was the first country I went to requiring an exit test. Any other airline would have sent an email letting their customers know, but not IndiGo. As a result, there was chaos at the airport and I missed my flight, along with 10 others. I flew the next day Kathmandu to Chennai (after paying 10000 rupees fare difference) with a short layover in Delhi. I was assured by IndiGo staff at check in that my bag would go straight through to Chennai, and they put Chennai as the final destination on the baggage ticket, so there was no reason for me to go to baggage collection in Delhi. Upon arrival in Chennai at 1am after a delayed departure, I was told my bag hadn't arrived because I was supposed to have cleared customs at Delhi Airport. It's now been 3 days, my bag is still in Delhi and IndiGo have no idea what's going on. They don't even know the right number to call at Delhi Airport to get an update. At the end of the day, fly IndiGo if you want a cheap flight and can count on things going according to plan, but don't expect any support if there are any disruptions as they don't appear to have the customer's best interests at heart.",no

Their website had a problem then why should I suffer for it, hence I requested a full refund for which they are not willing to give. I called them and after talking to their customer service for 01 hour or more, she would not give a full refund, neither solve the issue nor let me speak to her manager and wanted me to book for another date. From her I understood that the 04 Jan 22 flight was cancelled and they rescheduled the 05 Jan 22 flight, which I did not want due to the change in timing and fly with another airline as I have to reach on 05 Jan 22 early morning. These guys go by On Time departure and Arrival but none of that is true. So all of you be beware and customer service has a few lines which they repeat for every question and it really annoys you as this is not the right reply in English for a question asked. Pathetic situation to cheat you out of your money as when you cancel they get a free amount of INR 5,500/-. Disgrace to this company and the people who work for it and own it. Really cheap strategy.",no
IndiGo,5,"""it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage""",V Reddy,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | On the return flight from Indore, the check-in of the luggage was done very swiftly as we reached the airport well ahead of departure. The boarding also started well on time. One thing that was observed was the huge amount of cabin baggage and the size of that baggage was also very big and yet there were no checks related to the hand baggage performed by the airline staff because it seemed that a lot of luggage were exceeding the 7kg limit and also the dimensions. Perhaps time for the airline to start checking hand luggage? The crew instructed the passengers to keep their backpacks under the seats but during take-off it was observed that a lot of passengers were keeping the backpacks on their lap which was a gross safety violation and yet the crew did not enforce the safety policy properly. Being efficient and on time is important, but never at the cost of safety. The flight itself was uneventful with a upma / tea snack provided as part of the corporate fare and reached on time. I appreciate flying with the airline, but customer satisfaction should never come at the expense of safety norms as this would impact any evacuation procedures. Perhaps this is something that should be kept in mind. And also it's a good time to start checking the weight and size of cabin baggage taken on board the aircraft as well to avoid such incidents in the future. The rating is given based on the safety violation of not stowing away the cabin bags under the seat during takeoff but apart from that the flight and crew were really good.",yes
IndiGo,9,"""could not have asked for anything better""",S Vanush,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had to go Indore for a family function and on this particular flight, we had checked in online and as the fare booked was a corporate fare the seat selection was free. At Bangalore airport, there is a separate section where the passengers can just drop off their bags and the staff there ensure that the bags are checked in which seems to be a much faster process and this is something that other airlines can emulate in order to reduce the waiting time in queues. Also another point to note is that even though the kiosk machines were not working and were unable to print the boarding passes, one can use the mobile boarding pass on the mobile phones for security access. This is also something I experienced first hand and was very valuable. The boarding started on schedule and the flight itself was very comfortable and as the booking was a corporate booking, one is entitled to a single meal and a beverage. I selected the paneer masala rice as it was in the afternoon time. The food was pretty decent along with the tea. Staff service was prompt and polite. Arrival was 30 mins ahead of schedule which was appreciated and the crew was wearing a smile on their faces even while de-boarding and thanking the passengers. Overall could not have asked for anything better.",yes
IndiGo,2,"""we are very disappointed with the airline""",Akhil Pavi,27th February 2022,"Not Verified |  To start with, we were travelling to Male, Maldives from Cochin using Indigo, we had booked our flight from Cochin to the Maldives and then onwards to Bahrain. The check in counter staff member reacted very differently to us trying to travel telling us we are supposed to book a return flight back to India from the Maldives as per ‘air bubble agreement’, since we didn’t have time to review the reasons mentioned by the airline, we had no choice but to book a return flight to India. This was not enough for the airline, they wanted a direct flight back. We again made our travel agent rebook, while we didn't cancel our flight to Bahrain, since we didn't trust the totally misinformed Indigo staff, we travelled, spent days in the Maldives and travelled to Bahrain without any hassles! We checked and rechecked with Male airport as well, no such rule was there! Wrong information besides being totally un cooperative towards customers, we are very disappointed with the airline, especially as I have never experienced this. We had asked to meet with the manager, instead of asking him to come to talk to us, we were sent to some counter where he was seated fidgeting with his phone, laid back and totally uncooperative. I am not a person who likes writing such reviews but such incidents are very very problematic. Hope Indigo take appropriate action.",no
IndiGo,2,"""flight had no meal supplies""",Sumit Arora,27th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight had no meal supplies and I had a meal booked with my ticket.  I was offered cashews & almonds in place of a meal at 8 PM. The Air Hostess told me ""There are more options available but today we don't have any."" This happened when I was sitting in 6th row, I can only imagine what people in 16th or 60th row had.  Why would you charge money for a meal & not provide it?",no

The lady at the checkin desk was really helpful, she first refused but later checked with Chirag and than it was run run run - he guided me to the boarding gate. Made my London flight on time Can’t thank him the the check in desk staff enough. Saved me from panic attack. In the last 10 days I have travelled at least 5 times with the Indigo.

The staff said, I am late, they were not allowing me to board. But with the support of two employees of Indigo Airlines Ruksar and Satendra are really nice people. They understand the situation.

IndiGo,10,"""the seat selection was free""",V Sharun,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  When doing the online web check in, I was pleased to note that since I had booked using a corporate fare, the seat selection was free and also I was entitled to 1 complementary snack onboard the flight. The baggage drop process was smooth although due to huge queues at Bangalore airport, the IndiGo staff quickly collected all the bags from the pax in a separate queue which allowed quick deposit of the bags. Boarding started on time and I learnt that for the complementary snack, there was a choice of upma / poha for veg items and chicken noodles for the non veg items along with the choice of a beverage (hot / cold). The sandwiches could not be availed as part of a CPML booking as I found out but the quantity of the items was on a generous side which was appreciated. The flight landed also on time at Kolkata, however the baggage took some time before coming. In the end, I got more for what I paid for including free seat selection and a complementary meal, and got safely to my destination on time. Cannot ask for anything more.",yes
IndiGo,10,"""one of the top LCCs in Asia""",H Sharvun,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  At Mumbai airport, during check in, the staff took care to verify the negative RT PCR reports of all the passengers travelling to Karnataka which was appreciated even though the seat selection during online check in was not free unlike the previous time when I flew which was a surprise. Boarding started well ahead of schedule and it seems that Indigo is deploying with high capacity Airbus A321 Neo aircraft on high density routes to get as much passengers and load as possible. The crew was welcoming and wished everyone during boarding and deboarding which was much appreciated as these small things do matter. The luggage could have perhaps come a bit earlier than expected but apart from that there is nothing much that one can fault IndiGo on because everything was perfect: the fare, the on time arrival, the crews attitude. It has rightly achieved it's status as one of the top LCCs in Asia.",yes

I reached the airport at 7:25 am and was standing in the IndiGo line for check-in. Around 7:32 am, the IndiGo lady asked where I was going and other few passengers as well. When we informed her that it was Lucknow, the lady removed us from the line informing us that the counters had been closed at 7:30. She was very stubborn and was not ready to listen or even guide us on what to do next. The next 20 min just flew by running from indigo counter to counter. The lady on the reservation counter didn't even inform me of the fact that if a customer missed their flight and books it via their counter the fee charged is Rps 1800 and the PNR given is the same. A customer doesn't need to restart their booking again. Luckily my husband guided me on this procedure to which the lady confirmed.",no
IndiGo,10,"""the seat selection was free""",V Sharun,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was pleased to note that during the online check in for this flight, the seat selection was free because in previous experiences of flying with IndiGo, they usually charge a fee of around Rs 150 for selecting a seat. The baggage drop was a smooth process and departure was on time. The crew took steps to check for negative RT-PCR reports or proof of fully vaccinated during the time of boarding which was appreciated. Arrival was on time and IndiGo did the job of transporting from point A to B in a fairly reasonable price for a 1 hour 40 minute flight.",yes
IndiGo,10,"""Thank you IndiGo""",Ashish Khokar,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Yesterday (11 july) I brought my 90 year old mother back and from entry to exit, each member of IndiGo staff provided exemplary care. From wheelchair to security to plane they took genuine care. The surprise started by Sujata politely asking if we would like front row seats, which I had wanted but while booking couldn't get. That gave us comfort in 2 hours flight and Sujata accompanied us through security, which often can be cumbersome. Other staff too helped selflessly. Cabin crew was kind. Covid protocols are followed to a T by IndiGo. In Bengaluru on arrival Keertana helped and escorted all through till exit. It made travel with a near blind, wheelchair bound mother very doable. Thank you IndiGo. Way to go!",yes
IndiGo,1,"""obscene cancellation/change fees""",T Patusa,10th September 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have not flown on this flight yet. It's a future reservation that I have with them, and need to cancel because my onward/return journey between Mumbai and Seychelles that was part of the overall travel itinerary was cancelled due to Covid restrictions in Seychelles for passengers from India. So I need to cancel these IndiGo flights, as I have no need to travel to Mumbai and back now. When I call the customer service line to cancel, I get the following: They mention flight fees and changes on their website but fail to mention that they charge these per passenger per flight/sector when you need make changes or cancellations to your reservation. For a $180 round trip flight booked for my wife and I from Tirupati to Mumbai and back, they were saying I will get a refund of $28 even though I'm canceling almost 2 months in advance. Based on their USD cancellation fee of $45 that should be charged for cancellations made 4+ days before departure, I should receive a $135 refund. Or if they were strictly following this fee applied per person per flight, then that would be $45 per person per way, i.e. $45x4=$180 so I should not receive any refund. But they make an arbitrary calculation that I get $28 refund. They pretend to be a low-cost carrier that's friendly to the middle class in India, but actually charge obscene cancellation/change fees.",no

IndiGo,8,"""provided with a covid-19 safety kit""",S Venkatesh,10th September 2021,"Not Verified |  Recently I flew on Indigo on Economy class from Coimbatore International airport in India to India's capital city's New Delhi Indira Gandhi INTL airport.  This is my second flight after the pandemic lock down, things have changed a lot after the pandemic. The online check-in and selection of seats which is chargeable has been made mandatory, my flight was a bit behind the schedule departure time. As a low cost airline there is no In-flight Entertainment and food have to be pre-booked online and you also have the option to buy onboard with limited selection. All the passengers seated in the aisle and window seats were provided with a covid-19 safety kit that had a face shield, a face mask and some sanitizers, the passenger who were about to be seated in the middle seats were provided with PPE kits. As I had pre-booked the in-flight meal, I had to select from the list of available options and I had opted for a prepacked bottle of fruit juice and a bowl of prepacked readily made south Indian food. The food was above average even though it was a prepacked one.",yes

IndiGo,10,"""I had a great experience flying IndiGo""",D Reddy,17th March 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | As always I had a great experience flying IndiGo. It was a quick one day trip from Lucknow to Goa and also my first in over a year since the pandemic. I was very impressed with the ground and cabin staff ensuring all the passengers maintained social distancing while boarding and in the cabin during flight. Before boarding all passengers were given a Safety Kit packet which included a face shield,face mask and 5-6 pouches of hand Sanitizers, also the best thing was that all the middle seat passengers were also made to wear the safety gown along with the face mask and face shield which is a good safety measure. The inflight magazine wasn't available but understandable as they are trying to minimize the contact as much as possible. Water bottles were free of cost even though pre-covid IndiGo used to serve water in cups but it's nice they are serving water bottles free of cost and also in addition to that they are served free tea and coffee as well. Snacks and hot food items were available for sale, however, I had pre booked my Food item while making the booking and it was served in IndiGo branded pack and sealed and tasted as good as it looked. The flight did depart 5 minutes behind schedule but I won't mind 5 minutes given IndiGo sanitizers their aircrafts before and after every flight so I'd rather depart late than departing unsure of the safety. Overall an amazing flight experience with IndiGo. Great Price, Great Safety and Great legroom and Tasty Inflight Food!",yes
IndiGo,5,"""Cabin crew were nice, helpful""",K Sandi,17th March 2021,"Not Verified |  App is very nice looking, easy to use and never had an issue. I was able to book the ticket in no time. Interior of the flight requires some enhanced cleaning. They enforced the ones occupying middle seat to wear PPE. Cabin crew were nice, helpful, paid attention to all the unwanted needs of unruly passengers. I liked the bamboo cutleries, which is environmentally friendly rather than the plastic ones. Flight reached Delhi before the time and luggage came out on time. Everything was great except one major problem I had. I pre-booked my meal, which was a paneer salad. Salad was served with a bread roll. When I opened the bag, I found the bread had mould.  I showed it to a cabin crew, and she was apologetic and offered any food, drinks I want. I declined her offer and returned the paneer salad.",yes

She didn't even know where our arrival ticket was as it was lying in front of her. She didn't give us any option(s) nor reassurance or help. She was intent on ruining our vacation.

IndiGo,9,"""IndiGo does the job very well""",H Vashun,17th March 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our initial flight which was supposed to be a direct flight from Mumbai to Kolkata was cancelled and so as an alternative the airline offered various alternatives, one of which was via HYD which we took. The airline claimed that the flight was cancelled due to Covid restrictions but is clear that the flight was cancelled due to lack of good loads and so instead of the usual travel time of 2.5 hours the total flight duration was almost 6 hours which could have been better. At least during the online check-in the airline didn't charge us for paying extra for the seat selection which was a slight relief. Both the flight segments themselves were quite okay and departed well on time even though some of the conduct of the passengers was questionable like not wearing the face shield / hazmat suit for the middle row seats even despite the crew reminding the passengers to wear it numerous times. Nowadays when flying low cost carriers, it seems like a bus journey with wings where the airlines try to get as many passengers stuffed inside the aircraft as much as possible. If you are a passenger who likes to travel in a bit of exclusivity and luxury without feeling claustrophobic about the number of people surrounding you, you are better off travelling on other airlines. But if however, you prefer getting from point A to point B with slightly cheaper fares, then IndiGo does the job very well.",yes

The crew were so immaculately groomed and the cabin service was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble.

They hurt me emotionally and physically, 3 days spent at the airport just looking for a bag. I booked another flight and they told me my bag will be loaded. When I was boarding they said my bag isn’t there and no one knows where is it. They are the worst in the world. And if you’re thinking “ah they’re cheaper then others that’s ok” - it's wrong.

IndiGo,7,"""content with their services""",S Vanesh,5th March 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Bengaluru by Indigo. Check-in for the flight was smoothly done via the kiosks as well as the baggage security screening. The staff at the counter had informed in advance that the flight was going to be delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming flight which was good however on the notification screens it was still displayed that the flight was on time and this was only updated when the boarding was around the corner. The flight was delayed by an hour. So that meant instead of reaching the destination at 2310 hours, the arrival was at 2350 hours which was kind of late. At the boarding gate, there was an irate passenger who was taking his frustration out on the staff but the staff handled the situation extremely well. The boarding process was hurried as the crew tried to compensate for the delay which was much appreciated. The rest of the flight was pretty uneventful. However during de-boarding, the crew were polite and wished goodbye to me but not to everyone probably due to the fact that the crew were not expecting the rest of the passengers to thank them. Baggage was also retrieved in a safe condition. As a paying customer, I am content with their services and even though things like delays can happen in a congested area like India, they get the job done.",yes
IndiGo,9,"""by and large a flawless flight""",N Sharvin,5th March 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Kolkata. On this early morning flight, I had arrived at the airport much ahead of schedule and despite that, I still managed to check in and print the boarding pass selecting my seat which saves on the money if one were to check online. Baggage drop was easily done and the agent at the desk was with a pleasant demeanor. Boarding started ahead if schedule on this flight and was warmly greeted by the flight attendants. As it was during the Christmas time, the background music was related to the holidays which was a nice touch. Departure was on time and the rest of the flight passed off uneventfully. Arrival was on time and was able to collect my baggage as well. Only thing I observed was that the key chain of my bag was missing even though the contents of the bag appear to be intact. And I am not sure if the airline or any of the baggage handlers might be responsible for the loss of the keychain. But it could quite easily have resulted in the loss of any other items so I am not sure. This aspect has the only negative over what was by and large a flawless flight.",yes
IndiGo,1,"""flight was delayed""",D Nelson,13th December 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | Indigo claims that they are an ""on-time departure and arrival"" airlines. This is a joke. I have flown Indigo from Nagpur to Pune for the fifth time this month and yet again this flight was delayed as it always does. This time the delay is more than 5 hours and I am writing this review while waiting for the delayed flight. This particular route's flight always gets delayed and by now Indigo should have taken note and tried to fix the root cause of the issue. How can the same route flight get delayed always? Every single time I have flown from Nagpur to Pune with Indigo, there have been delays. On top of that, there is no refund or alternatives offered for the inconvenience caused due to delays. I could have definitely preferred some other airlines if there were options available for night departures. Unfortunately only Indigo fits into my schedule and I have to choose it for business purpose. I hope Indigo takes note and corrects this issue.",no

He promised that I would get a response. This happened on my domestic flight on 6 Dec. I did as I was told - wrote three emails and I received exactly the same computer-generated reply from 2 different customer service officers.

Varanasi to Amritsar via Delhi with IndiGo. Four domestic flights in India, ranging in length from one to three hours. The planes are clean and fly on time. The cabin crew are kept very busy, so don't have a lot of time to be friendly to passengers. In most cases boarding and disembarking is via a bus, but it's pretty well organised. (There was only one chaotic boarding experience, when the airline was trying to make up lost time due to a late arriving inbound flight.) The seats offer reasonable legroom. We prepaid the Prime package - with extra baggage, seat selection and a snack and drink - and found that this worked very well on all four flights.

The airline IndiGo is no different. Keeping in mind that this is a low-cost carrier, it was virtually impossible to tack any negativity onto this airline. They embrace a fun outlook on just about everything, from their inflight magazine, titled ‘6E’ (pronounced ‘sexy’), to their luggage buggies on the tarmac, called ‘Ground Force’. Yes, the seats are narrow (no worse than any other budget airline) and they don’t recline, which is a blessing when you’re trying to watch a video on your tablet/phone – that’s right, the seats do not have monitors built-in. You pay for food and beverages (it’s the norm now), but the prices are fair and some of the snacks are served in fun packaging that you might even want to take home. I know I did. I still have my ‘Nut Case’. Blue is my favorite colour, and now IndiGo is my favorite budget airline. Four Thumbs Up",yes

We were held for about 20 minutes without enough seat there. At KTM airport, check-in was fairly nonchalant, again no smiles.

While checking in from Cochin the ground staff at the counter gave us seats [19F and 19C] saying it’s seated together. Later I realised she did a mistake and it should be 19D. I was walking through the airport randomly looking for your staff to sort this issue out and found one of your agents. She looked through it and tried from her end and told me it won’t be possible at this time as other seats are already occupied and you can do it on board and there is a lady seated at 19D. I told her my daughter is already tired from the Male flight and it’s important for us to sit together. She understood our situation and told she will try her best. At time of boarding I explained the same situation to boarding agent. She replied the same saying you should try it on board as nothing she could do it now. There comes the pleasant surprise! This staff member came all the way to our gate which she doesn’t have to bother doing at all. She literally looked for the passenger seated at 19D and talked to her and agreed to swap seats with mine. I was very much overwhelmed with her genuine concern towards our issue and how she went well and above to sort this out for us. Please pass my sincere gratitude to her. She deserves it. However on other hand on board it was totally opposite experience. I know it’s a short flight to CNN but crew didn’t make any effort to do the service for this flight. They didn’t took the food cart out to the aisle or neither brought the round of water at least. They were just busy in the galley throughout until landing. I never even saw them securing the cabin! When the captain made announcements they went to the seat ready for landing. In contrast on the CNN to COK flight I received full service like any other flight and I was amazed the way they ignored the cabin just like that inspite of full flight.,no

Because of two ground staff intervention, they helped me realize the facility of International customers and their luggage benefits.

Even other low-cost airlines (eg. Jetstar) will allow you to pay for extra carry-on weight.

I was flying with two elderly passengers with knee problems as this took a big toll on their leg having to wait for a long while.

I had a friend also traveling with me whose luggage was less than 15 Kg. I asked the indigo staff if my excess luggage can be adjusted with him. Staff  told me to pay the extra amount. I immediately agreed to pay. Hence as per the baggage policy, I paid 400*10Kg -4000Rs. On arriving at Kochi airport after a 40-minute wait, I discovered that one of the luggage was lost and reported to the baggage claim representative. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, she cross-checked with the boarding pass and confirmed me that the bag of 10Kg is missing. I spoke to the indigo staff and have no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage. One of the senior officials of Indigo called me on June 9th and confirmed that the bag weight was 10Kg and a refund of 3500INR will be given. I expressed a complete dissatisfaction as I paid 4000Rs extra for the same bag. The staff promised me that he will check with the finance department and revert back.

IndiGo,2,"""no options for hot meals""",S Marbanian,31st May 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Istanbul via Doha. We had booked the XL seats in the 1st row for Rs 1000 each considering the nearly 10 hours journey, but realized what a mistake that was. First of all, Indigo added a stopover in Doha, which meant a direct flight that was advertised as 8 hours duration at the time of booking, became nearly 10 hours. The seating configuration is identical to the domestic flights, with just a few more rows added in the back since the A321 is longer than the A320. This means that they use the same seats (with just about 4 cm of foam padding). The in-flight menu has no options for hot meals to be purchased, and the best food you can buy on-board is cup noodles made with hot water. Even Air Asia, which is a much more LCC provides options for passengers to purchase hot meals for all their flights. Additionally the flight does a 1 hour stopover at Doha during which they park in a remote bay, and open the doors for crew and cleaning. This means that if you are seated near the front of the plane, you will be exposed to hot desert winds of Qatar for about an hour. On top of this, even though the crew announce that certain rows such as the first row, emergency exits are paid seats, they do not do anything to prevent random people from sitting in these seats during the flight. Why on earth should anyone pay for these seats beforehand then, only to get scammed during the flight like this? On top of this, the crew treat the first row like the ""toilet waiting area"", since any passenger who is waiting in queue to use the toilet needs to be seated when the seatbelt sign is on. But the crew instead of sending them back to their seat, make them sit in the first row, which is a paid row.",no

The worst part is if they had not wasted my time in queues when I had already mentioned I was in a hurry, I could have gone outside and gotten a printout.

As I went to drop my bag at the check-in desk, a barrier was lower, so I took a shortcut and stepped over it. Straight after staff come up to me and with a intimidating attitude asked me: is everything ok?! At first I didn’t realise, but then I told me in that I should not step over the barrier as a matter of security. Honestly I felt very embarrassed, so I apologies. Few seconds after I saw some older guy doing it, but staff looked away. Then another guy did it in front of him, and staff smiled away. So I asked staff why it was ok for some people to do it and not for me? It was then become aggressive and rude, so I decide to let the argument go. He should be fair with all, no just pick arguments with foreigners so that he can feel good and embarrassing customer in front of all. I hope Indigo can address this with staff and provide him with a customer service training. He is the face of Indigo when people arrive at the airport, and people like him can ruin the reputation of Indigo. Then on the flight they didn’t have changed for cash payments and instead wanted me to buy more things.

They went out of their way to accomodate me. I left my laptop and phone in the security check line because I got distracted by all the rigorous questions asked by the security personnel and my stuff got separated from my bags they were checking, so I did not realize I did not put the laptop and phone back in my bag. On the plane I finally realized and we started calling the lost and found at the airport in Hyderabad. They were closed because it was Sunday. In Rajahmundry we spoke with IndiGo personnel and the airport manager who helped me get hold of someone from the airline in Hyderabad and assure me that my articles are secure with them. They even offered to send my stuff via a next available flight but I was coming back the next day, so I was just willing to pick it up then. In Hyderabad staff were very pleasant and helpful and quickly gave me my articles after checking my identity. Someone from Indigo actually went to the security, got my stuff and kept it at the counter. Everyone went above and beyond and I quickly got everything back but knowing that my stuff was safe waiting for me on a Sunday night was very reassuring and stress relieving. Thank you, IndiGo staff. I am not familiar with airlines in India but I would recommend them to anyone who is traveling within the country.",yes

Due to the flight schedule modifications due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts, I had to do a last minute booking on Indigo which came at a steep price but as I was required to travel had no other choice. The check-in was a breeze and boarding / departure started on time. The aircraft was well maintained and even though every seat was practically full, the crew did well to manage things and requests from fellow passengers. The seat pitch is around 30 inches which is decent enough but might be more uncomfortable for someone taller. The flight was very smooth and the crew were very pleasant and indulged in small talk among the passengers when it came for the in-flight snacks which were kind of pricey. Arrival was on time and the captain of the flight announced that this was his last flight and so all the passengers were requested to send their best wishes to the captain during de-boarding which was a nice touch. A very pleasant flight experience indeed. Thank you Indigo.",yes

Opted for IndiGo as the timings were good, Check in was a little slow and so was boarding - their staff at the gates was asking people to check their bags in at the boarding gate so there was some confusion. The aircraft was a slightly older one. Seats were okay, since this was a corporate booking, got a XL seat over the wings.

I got checkin lounge where i can rest and have some food at odd hours and went to gate, boarding was already open one hour before departure and we were on our seat 30 minutes and gate close as every one had boarded. Boarding was smooth no drama. Flight was ready for take off and at that time it was advise that there is problem with aircraft and hence the flight need to abandon and change of aircraft and brought aircraft back to gate. Spend another 3 hours and finally took off. I can say that they had managed transition very smoothly. Aircraft were clean and toilets were clean too. staff were smiling and food was nice tea and upma which was preordered. Flight landed on time.

By the time we were checking in it had become apparent that she was in no condition to fly. Fortunately to us, an employee of Indigo Airlines saw that my daughter was suffering. He invited us to an empty office where a short time later we were met by a doctor who examined my daughter and gave us medication and electrolytes. As a result my daughter's condition improved and we were able to take the flight after all. The help that we received was initiated by the attentive and very friendly Indigo Airlines staff. It was quick and un-bureaucratic with attention to detail (the staff organized a wheelchair and gave my daughter and us expedited access to the plain).

IndiGo,1,"""our terminal had changed""",Ishita Bhowmick,12th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  
On May 30th, 2018 my husband, mother and myself were supposed to catch our flight from Delhi to Goa with Indigo. However, the day before our flight we received a message stating that our terminal had changed due to renovations in the airport. My husband had called the airlines to confirm and was told that our terminal had in fact changed. Once we arrived at the Delhi airport, security wouldn’t let us inside the airport and he kept telling us we were in the wrong terminal. We told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change, but he still didn’t want to let us in and asked us to go to the Indigo customer care outside of the airport. When we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one Indigo agent that was there. After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he can’t help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to “deal” with us that was even less helpful. By this time, boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldn’t do anything. We asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that. She said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed. By this time, all early flights were gone, and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to Goa for May 30th were booked. We booked our flight with Fly Air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at Delhi. We called the hotel in Goa to advise them we wouldn’t make it to the hotel that day, but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day, but unfortunately we couldn’t. Because of the service from Indigo airlines and wrong information given to us by them, we had to spend 6 times the price of our original flights, lost 1 day of hotel in Goa and had to book another extra night in Delhi.",no

I finally made it to the counter at 8.11am and noticed the only 2 checkin agents were now panicking as the flight due to depart at 8.40 needed to close. Passport and visa were presented, boarding pass printed however the agent then required details of my departure from India, fare enough. I took around 1 minute to pull up those details on my MacBook - a reasonable time frame however the agent in charge elected to close the flight, instructed our boarding passes be ripped up and even though I showed the departure details was met with a sorry flight closed approach and checkin agents walking away.

It cost us our return ticket, unnecessary stress at the airport, and an extra USD $2000 for alternative and last minute flights to make it back home.

The booking process is extremely cumbersome, also it seems to be mandatory to pay for every single aisle seat on this airline. All payment options for international passengers incur convenience fees which is extremely annoying. On Jan 3rd, needed to change the return flight. Tried to do so online but in vain, the online portal just returned cryptic error messages. Sent an Email to Customer Service asking for advise to change flights as its not possible online. Promptly, on Jan 4th received a response which was completely unrelated and misleading, incl the proposal to contact their domestic call center for further help. Went down to their local agent & explained the issue. Nevertheless they talked me though the online process again. When I was about to leave their office I was told that online modifications only work using the Google Chrome browser.

Although Indigo is good in time management and on time departure, they have deteriorated in terms of customer service.  Although the flight was on time, it took 52 mins to receive the luggage. Also it was surprising that they put the luggage of two adjacently arriving flights on the same belt. This is just not to allow the belt to remain empty. The luggage keeps coming so much less in number and the passengers keep staring at the belt expecting their luggage to come.The attitude of the ground staff is rude.

I do not understand , why nobody from the airlines did not bother to check when my return flight was and why they did not call me and instead just sent an email. Luckily, i checked my mail on sunday the 4th, otherwise my whole travel plan would have been jeopardized. And when i call the support number, that person says there are two options - 1. He can cancel and refund or change the flight to take flights with layover in between And when i said i need to be in Vizag in the morning, he suggested a flight in the midnight i.e at 00.05 hours from Bangalore to Chennai and that the connecting flight to Vizag would be from Chennai in the morning at 6.50 i.e with a layover of 5 hours and when i asked if indigo can make any lounge arrangement for those 5 hours, he says that Indigo cannot help in that regard and that i need to take care of the stay during the layover. Since the airline changed the flight schedule, they should at least compensate with an arrangement to stay during the layover -  (if we change they charge difference or if we cancel, they have t&c that there will be percentage deduction in the refunded amount.

They are completely understaffed and unprofessional about handling the case. It took 40 minutes just to reach the ticketing counter to explain my case and then I was left with over 1 hour before departure. Rather than trying to fix the issue, they were just trying to get more money by asking me to book a fresh ticket. Since this was happening 1 hour before departure, I could not even cancel my ticket. Had they been quick about it, I could have corrected the issue and boarded the flight. But instead, I had to book a new ticket for an airline later in the day and lost money on the previous one too. With a security lapse, I was allowed in the airport(name on ID not matching my ticket). This was surprising in the first place. Rather taking this case to fix their security issues, they were still bent on just asking me to book a fresh ticket. No wonder there is a huge room for improvement.

However, after immigration and security, just when I was about to board the flight, they had another scale and were measuring the handbags and wanted me to pay 60 AED (1100 Rs) per kg.

We were unaware that the CCU airport is a silent airport as other Indigo flight boarding were announced since we were listening intently awaiting our boarding call. We saw the last bus standing and we pleaded to let us in, the woman officer wanted us to let in but the male officer was arrogant and said no. The moment they heard that we are foreigners, they realized their mistake but they did nothing to correct it or help us out in any manner. They took the time to send back our luggage instead.

Well, a low cost airline in really had no expectations but at least a decent and hassle free experience as they claim to give. I checked in at the counters and got my boarding pass and I had a handbag of 6kgs which is well below their limit of 7kgs. I purchased duty free which was about 3 kgs. Here comes the tricky part the staff at the boarding gate have a portable weighing scale through which they check the weight of the handbags. I have no issues with that however I wasn’t informed at the counters about 7kgs handbag allowance being inclusive of duty free. The staff at the boarding gate (QAS) staff, were rude they do not even try to be polite of courteous and straight away give ultimatums saying throw away the duty free, go back to duty free and return it, however if you do no return in 20 minutes we will offload you from the flight. They forced me to pay 60 riyal per kg for the excess baggage which I was carrying. I wouldn’t recommend this airline unless a last resort or a complete emergency.

I had booked my seats under student discount which allowed an additional baggage of 10kgs free of charge. During my through leg from DEL to CJB, this promotion was honored and I paid for whatever excess I had, (excluding the 15kg+10kg allowance). But they would not agree that I had this promotion during my return leg and would not agree or believe me that I availed this in my first leg. I was astounded when the rep said there was nothing in the notes regarding the promotion. How can it be possible that you allow different baggage allocations for different legs. I ended up paying for the excess baggage which I had packed in anticipation of availing the 10 kg student discount. It was never about the money for me, but Indigo let me down in not acknowledging my promotion status.",no

Unfortunately, our flight from San Francisco to Delhi (Via Shanghai) got delayed and we missed the 5:10 am flight from Delhi to Vadodara. The Indigo staff at terminal 2 acted very helpful. They offered me to book in the next flight to Vadodara with minimal fee of fare difference, but unfortunately it was in the afternoon and not very convenient to us (as we were tired of traveling from SFO and really wanted to get home to as fast as possible). There was a flight to Ahmedabad at 7:40 am and we urged the Indigo staff to book us in that flight. They mentioned that the 'sector' (i.e. destination) was different and therefore the change fees would be higher. I said no issue as we were really in hurry. There was another problem though. That flight was from terminal 1 and it was already 6:20 am. The indigo staff suggested to go to terminal 1 first and then get my ticket changed there because there was no sufficient time and if I would get the tickets changed and then again miss the flight, I would lose more money. They offered me their shuttle to take me from terminal 2 to terminal 1. But with little time, we did not have time to wait for the shuttle and we just took the taxi. We barely reached to Terminal at 6:35 am. We had to get our tickets modified, checked in and boarding passes printed by 6:40 am to get into the Ahemdabad flight. That is when we met staff who had just joined her duties at the terminal 1 ticket counter and saw us coming with family in agitated state. I requested her to change my tickets to allow me to get Ahmedabad flight. She immediately realized that we needed urgent help and started working furiously to get the tickets changed and printed. In couple of minutes we had our tickets in hand and we rushed to the terminal 1 departure entrance. She ran with us to the entrance and requested the police to let us in fast. Then we ran to check-in area, she opened a new counter just to process our checkin and print our boarding passes. We could get the boarding passes just in time! Then she ran with us to the security area, asked other indigo staff to take us through the security fast and get us to the gate. We got to the gate as last passengers entering!

But why not charge ₹200-300 extra on any flight and serve a free meal. Snacks are ok but a meal will do better . Also , moving to terminal 2 at Delhi Airport was not a good idea. No Windows to watch outside for those who love plane-spotting. Also, there are no good passenger facilities available in terminal 2.",yes

I had an excess baggage of 5kg which I took back and repacked without any hesitation, Yet they behaved as if I was handling drugs.

IndiGo,9,"""a value for money indeed""",Arindam Mahapatra,28th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bhubaneshwar to Mumbai. IndiGo, being a low-cost no-frills airline is a value for money indeed. Although their in-flight menu is bit expensive, one can bring their food from home also, which also save some money. From ground handling to the crews' services, it was an excellent service. The students fare scheme is a boon indeed. Being a student, I always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6% basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance. I also prefer this airlines as they are the most punctual airlines. Looking forward to travel on IndiGo.",yes

IndiGo,2,"""Lack of flexibility""",S Richardson,27th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I travel with Indigo a lot and about half the time I regret it. They have all sorts of arbitrary rules that don't affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience. For example, a few times I've arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day. Every time they refuse despite having plenty of space - apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing. Today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg. Why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane? Lack of flexibility and customer orientation on this airline is consistently staggeringly bad. And it really irritates my sense of efficiency and reasonableness.",no

This time they directly rescheduled my travel. I was supposed to travel from Cochin to Hyderabad via Chennai. But they had rerouted me to Mumbai then to Hyderabad. Before rescheduling directly they should have given me options of cancellation or showing next available flight options. I got delayed by more than 5 hours. Who would want to suffer without sleep for purely airlines mistake?  When i ask for compensation they  say you should have called before starting your travel.",no
IndiGo,2,"""poor quality of ground staff""",Gokal Chittaranjan,27th April 2018,✅ Trip Verified |  Bangalore to Singapore. Horrible experience with check in staff at Bangalore. We had an onward flight from Singapore to Jakarta on Singapore Airlines. The check in staff refused to check us in saying we did not have Singapore visas. We explained that we were transiting at Singapore so did not need a visa. They refused to accept. I explained that at Singapore it is possible to freely transfer between terminals T2 & T3 without needing to pass Immigration. They refused to agree and insisted we required a Singapore visa. After much discussion they allowed us to board after they realized we possessed valid US & other visas. Wereached Singapore and there is no requirement to pass Immigration. Imagine if we did not possess other visas- would we have not been allowed to travel. Sad to see the poor quality of ground staff at Indigo.,no

Apart from one or two exceptions, every time the flight I booked was cancelled and I was re-booked on another flight. It was alright when the re-booking was done for another flight at the same time but lately the re-booked flights are at very inconvenient times. As a female passenger traveling alone, I could not accept the revised time of 21.50 reaching my destination at 23.05 for my last booked flight. The only other alternative for me is a flight one day later. Not to mention the unexpected delays in airport. I do not recommend IndiGo flights. The chances of getting your entire schedule messed up is pretty high with Indigo.",no

She arrived late at the airport in Mumbai. There was a flash strike by Uber which she booked earlier and she had to take an auto at the last moment to travel from Thane to the domestic airport. The Indigo staff at the Mumbai airport were very helpful in arranging to board the aircraft at the last moment. She was travelling alone and had no knowledge of Hindi. The Ground staff of Indigo also arranged to send her luggage in another aircraft travelling to Chennai. We had a few tense moments till she arrived safely here at Chennai. To our pleasant surprise the baggage was also delivered personally by Indigo staff at Chennai within an hour. I wish to place on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to all the Indigo staff who helped her out both at Mumbai and Chennai.,yes
IndiGo,8,"""good customer service""",J Haron,27th April 2018,✅ Trip Verified |  Trivandrum to Bangalore.

On my previous flights on IndiGo as well as Dimapur to Kolkata leg of this flight, I had inquired about buying the ""Girl Power"" Lapel Pin for my daughter and was told every time ""not available"". I inquired on this flight as well and the pin wasn't available but seeing the disappointment in my eyes, cabin crew  immediately took off the Girl Power badge off her uniform and gave it to me.

As always exemplary cabin service, efficient check in service. This time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb: I checked in and was asked if I had a PowerPac in my luggage and I said no. While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board! A exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an IndiGo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal. Many many thanks. On the downside, no Foreigner Arrival Cards on board the flight from BKK to Cal and no Thai immigration forms on the flight from Cal to BKK.",yes

IndiGo,6,"""seats were a bit tight""",Nafis Ahmed Raiyan,26th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew IndiGo from Kolkata to New Delhi. The check-in process was smooth and the baggage handling went well. I later found out as I had a ""Lite"" ticket, which was cheaper, I had to pay extra for my checked baggage. I did that. A bus took us to our aircraft. The plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time. The seats were a bit tight and legroom wasn't that good so I was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight. The head-rest of the seat also wasn't that comfortable. But you know, you can't expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrow-body type. With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle. The plane's air-conditioning had troubles, so it was a bit hot. At last, the plane landed on New Delhi after 2hr 5min. Experience could have been a little better even if it was economy-class.",yes

During that time, these are the things that I felt about the airline. 1) Check In: The Lines were long, the number of counters were pretty reasonable but could be increased considering the number of flights IndiGo operates. My advice, arrive early. 2) Aircraft: Neat. Clean aircraft. No problems. 3) Crew service: Pretty good. Up to standards. 4) Ground Support: I didn't face any trouble and the staff were pretty helpful too. 5) On Board Meal: it's not complementary. You have to buy it. Tasted good for the money. 6) Punctuality: On-time. No issues there. 7) Communications: Book online. You would get all the information via SMS, even the boarding gate information.",yes

Indigo is being quite careless these days, they mess up things and all we get to hear is ""sorry for the inconvenience mam"". Recently While booking the tickets i had selected a XL seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance, but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the XL seats including my father's, so today when we went to get our boarding passes, they said sorry mam, all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is, you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money. Its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through. Why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people can't handle it properly.",yes

My flight 6E 464 was scheduled for departure at 9:20am on 30 December and is finally boarding at 3:45 pm. In between this many flights for Mumbai has flown and Indigo crew remained clueless about this particular flight and spoke rude to passengers who we're enquiring. After the delay till 2:40pm the airline stopped sending any information to passengers via SMS or call.  At some point we were thinking as if we were waiting for some imaginary flight!

I am still not sure how long it would take me to finally board my flight today. I have a family event to attend but I think I won't be able to attend it.  It would be a customer delight if airline respects passengers valuable time and value for money.

Indigo provided no help getting onto the flight to Mumbai on Nov, 15. She had to walk to the gate. They issued the boarding pass but didn't wait for us and closed the gate 35 minutes before departure. They then charged me extra Rs.6500 to get us on to another flight. I have noticed the exact same happening to another senior citizen couple at the Mumbai airport on Nov 28th. When I objected they issued two tickets to the couple for free.

IndiGo,1,"""final flight I will book with IndiGo""",Bergen Stephen,26th February 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Had one of the worst experiences with IndiGo during a very critical moment. We had booked our flight 3 months ago. Our flight was from Trivandrum to Patna via Bengaluru. While we wer in Thiruvananthapuram we got a phone call from IndiGo 2 days prior to our departure saying that one my flights has been canceled and other one rescheduled. I was suppose to leave Trivandrum at 8:00 am and reach Patna by 3:00pm afternoon and we had to travel all the way to Nepal in order to attend a meeting on the very next day. IndiGo screwed us very bad and said they will provide us with a different flight but both on separate days. Now I am here in Trivandrum airport one day earlier to my actual departure and waiting for my flight which has been delayed once again. Now I will reach Bengaluru at midnight where I have to stay for 12 hours waiting for my next flight. Now my time and money are completely wasted. Staying over night in Bengaluru costs minimum ₹5000 and on top I'm stuck here wasting my time when I had to attend a party. This will be last and final flight that I will book with IndiGo.,no

Other than that, an impeccable flight, especially the superb cabin crew.",yes
IndiGo,1,"""as a worst experience""",Gaurav Surwade,20th November 2017,✅ Verified Review |  Goa to Mumbai. It was a worst experience we had at Goa airport while travelling back to Bombay. We got to Indigo counter at 43mins prior. However we were denied for boarding as we were 2 mins late and were asked to pay difference of 10500Rs for next flight. We tried requesting the ground staff but they were arrogant and didn't show any respect or courtesy. It seemed like we have to live on their mercy to get on board to get back to Bombay. As it was way below self respect we decided to book another flight with Air India and got back home. It was most inferior action by the Indigo staff which could have been avoided.,no

We had a eventful day flying from Dubai to Trivandrum, first upon check in we were told that we lacked a return ticket out of the country so our visa would not be valid. The check in lady was very friendly and explained it very calmly. So my son and I went to book a flight out of the country, returned to the check in counter, where the lady saw us and waved us over and let us jump the que. We proceeded to security where the staff was friendly and gave clear directions to passengers who did not know the rules yet. After security however things got exciting again, while presenting our boarding pass I heard the staff talk to each other and we were told there was something in our bag that caught their attention. All was said in an extremely friendly manner while we racked our brains trying to imagine what was in the suitcase. I was allowed down to the tarmac where I opened the suitcase and it was examined, it turned out to be a door stop I brought? The staff were friendly during all of this and let us into the plane with a smile. The flight itself was very nice the seats were more comfortable and spacious then our previous flights with Pegasus. All in all the staff was extremely friendly and professional.",yes

We had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate, we were advised to go back and sit. As the passengers were coming through the passage we couldn't make our way back to the seats. The air hostesses were extremely rude, repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats. They were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone. They asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious. In summary an extremely annoying experience, air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude, intolerant and unwilling to listen.",no
IndiGo,9,"""would definitely recommend""",Anjay Krishnamurthy,20th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | The service has been consistently good. Easily the best airline for domestic travel within India. In my experience they have been on time every single time (6 - 7 times a year that I flew). Extra legroom seats are charged nominally, no business class. Decent choice of snacks and beverages (no alcohol), crew are very professional and friendly. The aircraft could do with some inflight entertainment though. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone visiting India or flying out.",yes

This is my third experience with same flight - flight is delayed by 1hr 10mins, last time when I travelled a month before then it was delayed by 2 hours this is really horrible. Generally this flight is taken by one who attends office whole day and then come for flight and you face this issue again and again. Indigo will lose it's reputation if they continue to do so.",no

They had a flight via Mumbai where flight was to be changed. The ticket was under single PNR, I confirmed with customer care if the luggage will be through checked in & he confirmed it would be done. But at the time of check in, the officer denied & started asking me the name of person who confirmed. Now, who remembers the name of customer care executive! So, I had to take the luggage in Mumbai & check-in again. With no other option, I did take the luggage. The gap between the 2 flight was of about 3 hours. I was supposed to be transferred to International airport. When I asked the ground staff to arrange transfer, they were clueless & asked me to go out, hire a taxi & leave. I got upset, but instead of helping me, the Mumbai ground staff kept on arguing. The taxi took a good time to reach International airport, as it was peak hour. Finally we could make it just in time only to find that the flight was delayed. This is the first time I have seen that international flight booked under one PNR from an airline website.

This was my first flight with IndiGo and I was accompanied with my sister and her three children (2 kids and 1 infant). At Check-In we were given priority due to family. I was informed that they won't be able to accommodate us in one row as the seats were full. On my request, the Lady at the counter talked to her Supervisor and allotted us seats in the first row (which are paid seats) without any extra fee. That was really surprising and too generous of them. The boarding was smooth, the aircraft was clean and the food (paid) was good. It was a comfortable flight with very attentive and hospitable cabin crew. Even the ground staff was very helpful and courteous. The flight was on time and luggage reclaim was almost smooth. IndiGo definitely lived up-to it's tagline of on-time budget airline. Would definitely love to fly it again.",yes

The sound was again heard during landing too. The baggage at conveyer belt after the flight landed was messed up. On the same belt there was back to back baggage for 3 flights which was cumbersome and troublesome. I had to stand at the belt for an hour waiting to receive my luggage, it was very crowded with people looking for bags. Ground service was poor.",no
IndiGo,4,"""comfort might be a difficulty""",V Andrews,12th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.",no

Flew IndiGo from Jaipur to Kolkata. Take off and landing was smooth. Departure and arrival was on time. Seats were comfortable. Check-in was done smoothly. While boarding the aircraft the cabin crew welcomed us but not with their smiling faces.

On asking again twice, she replied twice ""I'll come back"". After that, I was given glass of water.",no

We were welcomed warmly by the cabin crew while boarding the aircraft. The aircraft seemed clean as compared to other airlines in India. The lavatories were also well maintained without any faul smell. The seats had a very soft cushioning hence it made quite a comfortable journey for us and were also wide. Though we had to buy food but it did not create any issues. Their food tasted fantastic. The flight departed and arrived on time. The landing and takeoff were very smooth.

The legroom was quite good. The food menu consisted of sandwiches, instant biryanis as well as instant noodles. I decided to go for sandwiches. They tasted good.

The flight was delayed by 2 hours and adding to that handling of baggage was horrible. Baggage of 6 flights was released on a single belt at the same time. It took almost 1 hour to find the baggage and to find the baggage I had to make my way through 1000s of passengers waiting for their baggage.

Today, my wife was supposed to travel to Chennai from Bangalore. The departure time is 7.20 am, the revised departure is at 9:15 am. Indigo used to be consistently punctual.

A caveat: In a hundred international flights into Bangkok in the past two decades, for the first time ever in my experience, an airline (IndiGo) did not have Thai immigration forms. Anybody who has been through immigration at Suvarnbhumi expects a wait of up to one hour. So, to not have immigration forms on board a flight can develop into an even longer wait. Come on, IndiGo!

Smooth boarding from Bangkok. Impeccable onboard service und attitude. Chaotic boarding at Kolkata: a long queue formed at boarding. Fine. Then an announcement was made by a ground staff member, in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 16-30 would board first. Since the announcement was barely audible, people waiting in the queue were confused, thus standing in line, not knowing what to do. Ground crew member - only one IndiGo staff manning their pre-boarding desk/area - did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board. People waiting. In the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person, spoke to him and were allowed to board. No idea if these people were going to occupy rows 16-30. Nothing happening; line not moving; IndiGo staff still looking as if he was in a daze. No repeat announcement, in an audible voice, re rows 16-30. Since I was in line, had a seat in row 21, I broke the queue, presented my boarding pass, and passed security. Don't know what happened after that. IndiGo needs to get its act together in this area.

On this trip to India, I was fortunate enough to try 3 different airlines - Air India, Jet Airways and Indigo. Indigo definitely scored best in terms of its modern fleet, however not recommended for international passengers due to its baggage restrictions. The fares aren't that cheap compared to other airlines, however Air India allows the most baggage weight. The staff are young and attractive, but truly inexperienced to handle situations. Personally didn't have a choice, since IndiGo had so many direct flights to remote cities.",yes

The outward journey started with a smooth and easy check in at Mumbai. Flight on time. The aircraft was clean and as per Indigo standards. What was very poor on this flight was the crew. The leading stewardess in particular seemed to sit and do not much while the other crew worked. Shame to see Indigo crew standards falling. It was also a morning flight but they had none of the breakfast options available - Ramen noodles were my best option. Return flight had a great crew but the Delhi airport check in was a nightmare. Long lines, people cutting lines. No Indigo crew to help. Quite a disappointing and sad experience. The days of looking for Indigo flights to book may be over.",no

Indigo has been my personal favourite for short flights. The flight crew is fairly good. I'm 6'1, and I find the seat compact but this is the same for all LCCs and not ideal on long flights. Cabin staff appearance is smart, they are courteous but not always consistent. There is no inflight entertainment on these flights. Short flights they are perfect, Medium duration okay, long flights not recommended.",yes

Booking in its website was easy and prices were competetive. Check-in at the airports was easy and fast - Indigo had many counters open in all 3 airports. Flights departured with no delays of more than 5 minutes. The airplanes looked new and very clean. Staff was nice and helpful. On two occasions I ordered a sandwich (about 250 rupees) which was quiet tasty to my surprise. The only downside that I can think of is that the seats are not very comfortable, but it's a low cost airline and flights usually last only 1-2 hours, so it's not such a big deal. Highly recommended.",yes

Their booking is hassle free through app on both ios and android. Web check-in is a breeze, getting any optional services is also good. The check-in is curteous and to the point. Mind you they dont allow even 1kg extra on planes without payment, plus they have also started to screen weight of cabin bag just before boarding the flight. Its a business model because they are a budget airline. The planes are clean with courteous crew. The leg space of economy seats is ample. I am a heavy built person and I have never faced space crunch in the seats. The in-flight food is okay, nothing to write about. I never had to wait for my baggage for more than 10 min.

Something I have written about in the past, the fact that the on board crew never has any Arrival Forms for foreigners, was finally rectified but, however, with an amusing twist: on my asking the cabin attendant for an Arrival Form, something that only non-Indian nationals need to fill, she very pertly asked me as to why I needed one since I look Indian. I replied that I was only 99.99% Indian, the remaining .01% being American as I carry that country's passport. (I did not mention that the Indian diaspora is the largest in the world.

IndiGo is not a full-service carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an IndiGo flight be sure that you reach on time. They have a record of on time departures. The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good. The meals served are ready to cook meals and some snacks also available with good range of beverages.,yes

Enquired from IndiGo staff attending at and they informed me that since the tube was marked 'fragile' it would arrive separately very shortly (which it did) and asked me if I was connecting to an IndiGo flight and on my answering, yes, I was, IndiGo said they will assign staff member to escort me and my luggage to domestic departures. A lady took charge of me and my luggage - she insisted on pushing my trolley, I insisted on doing it myself; I won - and took me all the way to IndiGo x-ray security. As I was carrying a bottle of duty-fee liquor in my carry on, and since liquor cannot be carried on domestic flights, I checked my back pack through x-ray and the IndiGo staff, to avoid bottle smashing, tied my backpack up very securely and put a fragile tag on it and asked the staff escorting me to inform IndiGo check in counter, where the pack was specially tagged and given to a baggage handler to carry it personally into the baggage room.

During Delhi transit, we were asked to stay in our seats while the crew changed and cabin was cleaned for on-going flight to Kolkata.

I believe Indigo keeps these seats reserved as you can pay on board to upgrade these seats but no one bothered me for moving to these seats.

IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,Shrivallabh Randad,3rd September 2015,We have taken the flight from Indore and we are regular flyers with Indigo. The seats were most uncomfortable. There was hardly any cushioning on the seat. Experience of seat was more or less similar to as if we were seating on wooden bench. You have already curtailed seat pitch and now the un-cushioned seats. You are requested to have some feeling for passengers minimum level of actual comfort also. Looking forward for better and more comfortable seats.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,B Vincent,3rd September 2015,"I recently took several flights with IndiGo and didn't experience any major issues. I checked other airlines before I booked and IndiGo were consistently cheaper, often by a wide margin. Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out. But these are minor quibbles, I would have no hesitation choosing IndiGo next time.",yes
IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,Kalpesh Ashar,3rd September 2015,6E 062. Service has deteriorated. On-time urgency once seen is no longer seen. Online seat booking charges for all aisle and window seats. You can only get middle seats for free. Too money minded.,no
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Pinaki Bhadury,3rd September 2015,"6E189 6th June. Low budget Airline - their fares are more or less the same if not more at times than full service carriers yet they continue to enjoy all the subsidies of a low budget airline. On time is a good thing - their flights are often now delayed or run late. Check-in process - everyone knows how long the queues are at the check in counters. Two days back on 4th June I did Web Check in for my 6th June flight using my smartphone. While I was successful in doing web check-in in spite of me giving the email address and phone no I did not get a copy of the boarding pass - beating the while process of doing Web check-in. At Delhi T1 terminal when I tried to print my boarding pass at the Check in Kiosk while it displayed the Boarding Pass I did not get my print out! On taking it up with the ground staff I got a casual reply - please stand in the queue even though I mentioned that the flight was due to board in next 35 minutes he simply refused to help me. As a result I reached the counter just 30 minutes before the departure of the flight and the check in lady commented ""Sir you are very late please be on time next time""! I have booked 3 tickets for my family through on-line booking system. After I had filled in all the passenger details I was asked whether I would like to take the pre-assigned seats facility and I declined and continued with my booking. But to my surprise and disappointment I found seats were allotted together that included an aisle and window seat along with the middle seat. When I tried to change the seats it did not allow me and charged me Rs 400 extra (Rs 200 each for Window and Aisle 'premium' seats) over and above the fare and there was no way I could change it.",no
IndiGo,3,IndiGo customer review,Roma Solomon,3rd September 2015,We were supposed to board our flight from Delhi to Lucknow at 12.15 on the 21st of May but there was confusion all around as the flight was late and the ground crew were not able to display any sign at the boarding gate or give us some explanation. Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.,no
IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,P Gould,3rd September 2015,Went from Delhi to Kochi because there is no such thing as a direct Delhi to Male (Maldives) flight and even with connections you have to mix and match airlines in order to get a halfway decent connection schedule. The airline is like the low budget carriers in Europe with people packed in like sardines. They don't have an inflight magazine that actually has anything to read or even a map with their air routes.,no
IndiGo,6,IndiGo customer review,Tan Ying Kuan,3rd September 2015,DEL-PNQ(Pune)-DEL. December 2014. Worst possible time of the year to fly out of Delhi. Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,M Herler,10th April 2015,Short haul from Delhi to Kathmandu. Clean on time friendly staff aircraft seemed new. Highly recommend Indigo for domestic flights in India or within Southeast Asia. Nothing special but low fares and definitely better service than Air India.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,B Dossin,10th April 2015,4 March 2015 Flight 6E178. 6 March 2015 Flight 6E665. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi back and forth and it was great. The seats were comfortable (I took the first row seat with more leg space) the crew were very pleasant and we arrived on time. On the way back I arrived 3 hours earlier in Delhi and they were kind enough to let me go on the next flight so I didn't have to wait at the airport. Overall my experience with Indigo was 5 stars!,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,S Friedman,10th April 2015,Chennai to Delhi in economy. Pretty short flight so it's hard to complain. Comfortable seats good service and we left and arrived right on time. We were 2kg over (in 2 bags) but staff let it pass. Would fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,2,IndiGo customer review,Manoj Chaumal,10th April 2015,Was travelling from Dubai to Mumbai. I was fond of Indigo before this trip. Check-in was smooth and my hand baggage was less than 7 kgs so there was no excess luggage charge. However got some shopping from the Duty free. As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.,no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Shyamala Seshan,10th April 2015,Jan 1-12 2015. Flight 6E 414 and 6E 461. BLR to Mumbai return. Being a senior citizen I had requested for travel assistance and was provided very promptly. The staff were very courteous and helpful. Here onwards I will prefer to fly Indigo Airlines and will recommend to others.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,P Ryan,10th April 2015,Mumbai - Thiruvananthapuram 25 Dec 2014 Flight SG215. A very good option for domestic flights in India. All flights we took were on-time. Efficient check-in at airports. Seats weren't that comfortable but for short haul flights you can't complain.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,M Riccardo,10th April 2015,Delhi to Mumbai on Dec 31st. I had a good experience flying Indigo. We left on time plane was new and clean and service was good. Only comment is that FAs should smile a little more but besides that I was quite impressed by the service and would definitely use them again.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,S Sankar,10th April 2015,MAA-BLR and BLR-BOM with a young family. Both flights were on time the aircraft were clean and the FAs very friendly and accommodating. Whilst we could not check in online with young children for some reason the check in staff ensured we were allotted the seats we requested. Staff were also flexible with us checking in most of our luggage (and exceeding the 15kg/person) instead of taking a carry on bag for each of the children making our lives easier. Bags were delivered even before we reached the belt in both cases. Streets ahead of Easyjet and Ryanair. The only domestic airline I ever book in India.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Purna Ananth,10th April 2015,6E 294 and 552 between BOM and BBI - Clean aircraft with decent leg space comfortable crew friendly and helpful good choice of food items for purchase on board. On time into BBI slightly delayed on return to BOM. Only negative was some luggage appeared on the belt very late at BOM due to a mix-up apparently. Overall up to the standards expected from Indigo.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Kumar Ganesh,10th April 2015,DEL-COK-DEL. Before time arrival on both the legs clean aircraft smiling hostess - what more can one ask for. By far India's best LCC.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Haresh Advani,1st December 2014,Flew from Poona to Calcutta and then a connection again IndiGo to Bangkok. Both flights virtually flawless. Have to always commend the cabin crew on their providing a comfortable flight. Noticed something new this time: on deplaning one of the cockpit staff emerges to join the cabin crew in bidding adieu. I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Adam Miller,1st December 2014,Delhi to Kochi last Friday. Check in was efficient by friendly smartly dressed staff. My check in bag was over the 15kg limit. When I mentioned that my hand luggage was much lighter it was suggested I transfer between bags thus saving a hefty fee. Good clean aircraft but the pre-ordered meal was a disappointment. A packed fast food instant rice or noodle concoction possibly the type served to astronauts in deep space.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,S Shivadasani,1st December 2014,Flew IndiGo November 11 to Kolkota from Bangkok. A full flight. On time takeoff very friendly and accommodating staff seats are ok cabin and toilets clean. Been flying IndiGo on and off the past few years and this has been my usual experience. Never tried the food but the cabin staff at least on this flight constantly asked - even though I never ordered any food - if I needed water each time the food cart went past.,yes
IndiGo,4,IndiGo customer review,Arup Ghosh,1st December 2014,"Delhi (DEL) - Kolkata (CCU) 6 Nov 14 6E219 - Was traveling with a small trolley bag (15"" diagonally) and a compact laptop bag (15"" diagonally). Total weight 11 kgs. Got the shock of my life when they said that they wouldn't allow more than 7 Kgs in cabin including laptop. Now I had a laptop and charger. Then I had a SLR Camera with lenses plus a change of clothes and some files. They asked me to pack all the fragile items into one bag and check-in the other. Imagine my situation. There was no way I could fit all the fragile items into one bag and weigh in at less than 7 kgs. I checked-in the bag and nothing was damaged. On to other aspects of the flight. The seats are cramped and the seat back is very thin. You feel the knees of the guy behind you! The food they sell is mediocre. If you want on time performance then probably this LCC is the best in India. But if you want customer friendly service comfortable seats good food or in-flight entertainment (none exists on Indigo aircraft's) or for that matter a reasonable cabin baggage policy then do look elsewhere.",no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Varun Ravichandran,1st December 2014,Chennai to Bangalore. The flight took off from Chennai on time with the captain warning us beforehand that there was very heavy weather over Bangalore that he would try to avoid. We eventually got to Bangalore airspace and ended up circling for 20 minutes or more until the captain announced that the thunderstorm had passed and we could land before our fuel situation worsened. Reasonably comfortable seat and friendly crew possibly the most efficient LCC in the Indian skies at the moment and wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.,yes
IndiGo,1,IndiGo customer review,Sriharsha Narasimhan,1st December 2014,Flight 6E 473 from Mumbai to Bangalore was delayed by 12 minutes at 22.02 HRS due to weather conditions en-route to Bangalore. However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.,no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Singh Ashutosh,1st December 2014,Flew from Goa - Delhi on 11 Aug 2014 Flight on time. Nice and clean aircraft. Wide range of snacks available for purchase though rates were exorbitant. The only negative point would be air hostesses being less interactive and involved.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,J Knibbe,1st December 2014,Flew from Delhi to Coimbatore and then from Chennai to Kolkata. This is an outstanding low-cost airline. I couldn't really find any fault with them! All staff were very friendly professional and helpful the planes were modern and spotless the captain gave informative and friendly announcements before during and after the flight the food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced; and the inflight magazine was well-produced. In Delhi we got stuck in a traffic jam caused by a sudden storm and so we only arrived at the aiport about 10 minutes before the flight. We assumed that we would miss the flight and have to make a plan B but the excellent and helpful staff quickly issued us boarding passes and rushed us to the plane so we still got away on time.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Narendra Gajala,1st December 2014,I quite often travel from Pune to Nagpur and I would always prefer Indigo over other budget airlines. The ground staff and flight crew is humble and helpful and they give you good attention when needed. Flight crew seems well trained and organized compared to crew of other airlines. In-flight food options are good and inexpensive. They serve coffee unlike GoAir. Ticket pricing is better than competition.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Tanmay Bhakta,1st December 2014,I flew with them from Bangalore to Pune recently. Ground staff at Bangalore airport were a bit disorganized but managed to get us on board fast. Seat was fairly ok but if you are a large person you will feel very uncomfortable as the armrests on this airline did not go up. After take off we were offered drinks despite Indigo being a budget airline. I felt a little hungry halfway through the flight and I manger to get a packet of chips for a cheap price. After which we landed in Pune fresh and nourished. Overall Indigo I feel has service that is better than any other budget airline that I knew.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,M Fewster,22nd July 2014,Flew Chennai Jaipur and return. Efficient service good value and organization from a cut price carrier. New clean aircraft friendly staff. Only problem was that out first booking had not actually been confirmed despite us having a booking number. I received nothing from Indigo to tell me this and I missed the small print on my booking. With an 30 minutes to spare a very helpful groundstaff person went to a lot of trouble to get us new bookings and got us the last seats on our flight. Brickbats for not providing better info re the not confirmed booking (we still don't know why) but kudos to the staff member who helped us in Chennai airport.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Patell Rishad,22nd July 2014,Flew BOM to Goa return and BOM to Delhi. The Goa flights were rescheduled many times and we got constant updates by SMS many weeks in advance. Check in at Bombay was smooth with the web check in counter being empty. Flights on time and service was good.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Prithvi Ramesh,22nd July 2014,Flew MAA-AMD on Indigo 6e-237. Check in went smoothly the flight was on time it was clean and appeared new and had ample legroom. The food was delicious. The flight crew were quick and efficient. Overall good experience and no problems. Would fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Rahul Kumar,22nd July 2014,Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Devayani Hirani,22nd July 2014,Kept waiting for more then one hour in the plane to pick up some late comers. I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality. Never again.,no
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Marek Wrobel,22nd July 2014,Last week I flew from BOM to Goa and return. Both flights were slightly delayed (ca 15 mins) but the quality of the service has compensated for these minor delays. The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals. In general comparing to European 'no frills' airlines IndiGo presents generally a better offering and service.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,M Satish,22nd July 2014,Chennai - Mumbai and back. On time departure clean aircraft efficient cabin crew and on-time arrival. No wonder that they are the most preferred airline for domestic travel within India.,yes
IndiGo,1,IndiGo customer review,P Kale,22nd July 2014,I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs. Moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them.,no
IndiGo,3,IndiGo customer review,R Manohar,22nd July 2014,Flight 6E 284 from Chennai to Delhi on 6th Feb 2014. I took the morning flight at 8.20 am this meant that I did not have my breakfast before the flight. The flight duration to Delhi is 150 minutes. I wanted to have my breakfast on the flight I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The air hostesses were slow and inefficient to say the least. They just walked past me and did not ask if wanted anything. They simply pushed the trolley past and went and sat down. I gave up and sat extremely hungry and frustrated.,no
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Chadha Jitender,22nd July 2014,Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,S Srinivasan,13th January 2014,"MAA-DEL. It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.",yes
IndiGo,3,IndiGo customer review,Patel Beena,13th January 2014,I flew from Pune to Bangalore on 30th December 2013 on Flt 6E 407. I bought a chicken sandwich for my son and it was awful! I usually fly Indigo Airline because of it's assurance of timely arrivals and departures. I've never had a reason to complain until my last experience. The flight was delayed. But the worst part was that the on board staff was inattentive and didn't even attempt to sell any meals on board. They just served passengers who had pre-booked their meals. When I asked for the chicken sandwich the flight attendant stared at me like I'd asked her to bring me an elephant from the zoo. This is the first time I've been on the receiving end of aloof treatment from Indigo staff.,no
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Purna Ananth,13th January 2014,6E 427 BOM-MAA and 6E 278 MAA-BOM. Airplanes were clean boarded on time arrived on time (may be even a shade early) crew were friendly and helpful. Food items requested were available and tasty. Only negative is that service on board was slow leaving no time for inflight sales.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,A Kashyap,13th January 2014,Nov 4 2013. Route: HYD-BLR. I have been a frequent flyer on Indigo over the years and the airline has never failed to deliver. As noted by others here spotless aircraft helpful crew members and on-time service are what set it apart. I recommend the airline to all my friends visiting India from abroad. I'm flying Indigo's international service for the first time next year and am looking forward to the same level of service.,yes
IndiGo,5,IndiGo customer review,J Sastry,13th January 2014,Pune to Delhi. I had booked my meals under Corporate Plan. I was served food only 15 minutes before the flight was to Land i.e 1.5 hrs after the flight took off. The service started late and then the crew were serving/selling in each row going back to front rows serving water discussing menu options with those buying and chatting amongst themselves. On other airlines food is first served to those who pre-book. After selling to all they don't have many items left for serving. Suggest they keep the standard menu and serve pre booked passengers first.,no
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,I Lancaster,13th January 2014,"DEL-TRV Nov 11. My first Indigo flight. As budget airlines go excellent! Actually strike ""budget""! You get what you pay for and you know what you're paying for and Indigo delivered to a T and with aplomb. New clean airy decor aircraft lovely FAs. And a lovely touch that others could copy: no jetway but instead of steps up they have a ramp so it's easy to get rollers up to the plane. Spent half an hour on the ground at Cochi during which the cabin was well-cleaned (lavatories included) and properly vacuumed. Compare that to Ryanair!",yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Debaditya Haldar,13th January 2014,I booked my tickets through Indigo to travel to my hometown in Kolkata during Diwali. I am impressed with the services provided by Indigo. A320's were clean and spotless with great sitting arrangements and ample leg space.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,M Jasuja,13th January 2014,Delhi-Bangkok-Delhi. New A320 aircraft's were clean. Since it is a budget airline they are very particular about checked in baggage and charge for every extra kilo. Even some passengers were nasty the flight attendants were friendly. I took my meal from airport so it was better and cheaper than on board. The flights were on time. I would fly IndiGo again!,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,A Swamy,13th January 2014,BLR-BOM return. On time departure arrival before scheduled time for both flights. Smooth check-in process and assignment of seats. Clean and spotless aircraft's legroom a bit limited though. Cabin crew very efficient and lot of smiles. Masala tea bought on board was tasty. Bus rides between gates and aircraft. On return leg we were transiting from SIN (different airline) and had excess baggage. They just checked the boarding passes for the international leg and did not charge anything extra as baggage fees!,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Prithvi Ramesh,13th January 2014,Flew from MAA to PNQ on 4th October. Check went on smooth. The flight was on time. The sandwich served onboard was excellent. Very clean and new aircraft. The flight arrived ahead of scheduled time. Overall wonderful experience. I would definitely fly with them again.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,S Naida,7th October 2013,If you are looking to enjoy a comfortable flight then look no further than Indigo. I am quite fussy about my travelling because of which I have completely put my faith in Indigo Airlines. I love the fact that the flights are punctual and the passengers are not made to wait. The flight attendants welcome you with a warm smile and make you feel comfortable. The flights are well maintained and the washrooms are also hygienic. The crew and the management have certainly done a wonderful job in keeping their patrons happy and satisfied. There was plenty of legroom available on-board even though my flight was full. If you are planning to travel with elderly people then do not worry. The staff are extremely friendly. This airline has always been my preference over others. I will strongly recommend their services.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Ranjeet Bhardwaj,7th October 2013,My job requires plenty of flying and I am a frequent user of Indigo. Everything is up to the mark the only thing that bothers me is the legroom I will say that it is really not comfortable. Flying again in November with Indigo.,yes
IndiGo,7,IndiGo customer review,D Gujrathi,7th October 2013,I flew from Pune to Chennai economy class 12.00 noon flight. Friendly staff but bad food and very poor leg space compared to other airlines. Clean toilets staff are helpful and friendly. Will definitely fly with Indigo again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Giridhar Penumarti,7th October 2013,DXB-DEL-DXB and was returning with my grandmother who was a wheelchair passenger. DXB-DEL the flight was half full and that allowed a lot of space to stretch out and sleep in comfort and while the outgoing service was excellent the return journey was par excellence. From the moment we arrived at T3 Delhi IGI our every need was met and every question answered with professionalism and friendliness. The ground handling staff member was very friendly and knowledgeable the check in staff at Delhi were very friendly and helpful and the crew of 6E21 provided service that cannot be faulted. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Indigo Airlines again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,S Menon,7th October 2013,Afternoon departure from Chennai to Mumbai. Flight delayed but informed well in advance. Easy Check in. The aircraft was spotlessly clean. They managed to turnaround the aircraft in 20 minutes. Saw passengers disembarking from the previous flight at the same time when we were bussed to the aircraft which I thought was quite amazing. The cabin crew were very professional and took time to individually ask passengers on the feedback about the flight and quality of service. Will fly them again.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Daniel Johnson,7th October 2013,Flew Indigo from Delhi to Bangalore and return. I have used Indigo several times over the years and the years and they have yet to disappoint me. I was particularly amazed at the great customer service and the cabin crew's happy attitude towards the customers. On-ground check in was fast and easy. Transfer from T3 (international terminal) at Delhi to the domestic terminal was a breeze this time around. Super clean planes. Will strongly recommend for travel for domestic flying in India.,yes

IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Rishad Patell,7th October 2013,Indigo from Mumbai to Goa and return. Flights were packed on both legs. We got emergency exit seats both ways as we asked for them. Great leg room and worth it for the 1 hour flight. Both flights on time. Service good. Planes are clean and they look new unlike many ageing Indian carriers. Value for money.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,A Krummacher,7th October 2013,I use Indigo regularly to fly BKK-DEL. Great airline with great fares! Easy to navigate website with no hidden costs. Never had any delays actual departure in many cases before the scheduled departure time. Extremely friendly and cheerful crew. Only complaint the rather expensive food and drink onboard and not accepting Indian currency on international flights.,yes
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Bansal Shailesh,7th October 2013,26 May 2013 Jaipur to Chennai. I saw some dirty used cups and wet tissues in the seat pocket in front of me. I highlighted this immediately to the cabin crew whilst boarding was going on. Told it would be cleaned in the next clearance and nothing could be done at that time. I was shocked and surprised with this answer. The cleaning was done in Ahmedabad by ground staff and then the flight took off for my destination Chennai. On time performance took higher importance over cleanliness and hygiene. The attitude of cabin crew was horrible. I will never fly Indigo again.,no
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,N Sundera,23rd May 2013,"Goa to Bombay. Flight delayed an hour ""due to runway issues"" in Goa. Ground staff very helpful and accommodating and blocked out 2 adjacent seats for us at the front of the aircraft. Aircraft (A320) was clean crew were efficient although a little harried with the buy-on-board meal service given the short flight time. Good value for money and would fly them again.",yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Kumar Ganesh,23rd May 2013,DEL-BLR-DEL. Both legs had a before time push back reached destination 10-15 mins early. Quick professional check-in.

IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,S Menon,23rd May 2013,Early morning departure from Chennai to Delhi. Boarding process completed before time and on time push back. Clean aircraft with an efficient cabin crew. Landed on time in Delhi. One of the best airlines to fly in India.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,N Sasilatha,23rd May 2013,New Delhi to Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi. Only Indigo has a direct flight in this sector at the time of writing. The flight experience was very good. Fare was cheap as booked early online selected the meal plus seating combination- Indigo Plus. Check-in and boarding was efficient flight departed and reached destination on time as per schedule. Though selected a standard seat on row 3the legroom was very comfortable. The aircraft was new and interior was clean. The only bad thing was the pre booked food booked online wasn't up to expected quality. Not sure whether its because we ordered vegetarian meal.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,Karl Moosbrugger,23rd May 2013,Used Indigo BOM-TRV for the first time main reason was no other suitable alternative available. The aircraft was spotless looked brand new and the crew attentive and very polite. Legroom is very limited but I knew that before so I can't complain and for a 2 hour flight I could survive it. Tasty snacks were sold at reasonable prices on board. Flight was on time.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Sidath Baranage,23rd May 2013,I flew with Indigo in August 2012. Given the hype about this airline I thought of giving them a try and they didn't disappoint. Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge. However there isn't much space between the seats and does feel a little cramped.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Alan Lacey,23rd May 2013,MAA-TRV and TRV-BOM. Easy to use website for online booking and immediate text confirmation to my mobile. Fast courteous check in . New aircraft comfortable seats and departures ahead of schedule. FAs were all smart friendly and attentive. Great fare and an extra 600 rupees (about £7.50) got me a reserved extra legroom seat food and drink. Food was fresh excellent quality and well presented. Everything about this airline was slick and professional with an element of fun. A great experience and highly recommended.,yes
IndiGo,8,IndiGo customer review,S Menon,23rd May 2013,Morning Departure from Mumbai. There was a snaking queue at check -in but the staff were very prompt and I got my boarding pass in 10 mins. Clean aircraft and push back 5 mins ahead of schedule. Landed in Chennai 15 minutes ahead of scheduled time. Good value for money.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,U V Naresh,23rd May 2013,I was supposed to fly from Delhi to Mumbai this morning (10.25am) on Indigo but Delhi airport was heavily fogged out and the runway operations had been shut for a few hours. I was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal. Upon arrival I was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and Indigo were unsure when departures would take place. They immediately asked me if I would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening I declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties. The whole affair was so well handled I was most impressed by Indigo's ground staff. This is one rare gem in the Indian aviation scene.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,Tasneem Yousuff,23rd May 2013,For the first time my husband and I travelled with Indigo airlines 2 days ago and were very sceptical as it was a budget airline and we had slightly excess baggage. To our surprise from our very first contact with the Indigo airline staff to the end of our trip we were impressed. The lovely young lady at Mumbai airport greeted us with pleasantries checked in our luggage which was a bit above the limit. Once on board on our flight to Singapore we found the seats spacious and comfortable the crew courteous and professional. The inflight service was excellent and reasonably priced. We purchased some spiced chai and cookies that came beautifully packaged in a tin. Regular announcements by the crew were clear and polite. Would gladly travel Indigo Airlines again and highly recommend it.,yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,W Montego,8th January 2013,Flew MAA-PNQ (Chennai-Pune). Excellent crew and food service. Seats were terrible and the plane was unclean. One thing I respect about IndiGo is their promptness. The problem with that was that as soon as all passengers had disembarked the next group boarded. Nevertheless the best domestic duty-free I've ever seen.,yes
IndiGo,,IndiGo customer review,Kapil Khandelwal,8th January 2013,I travelled from Bangalore to Jaipur. The leg space between seats was the length of my iPad. If the seat in front is reclined it would hit you face. Very uncomfortable amongst the low cost carriers. Looks like the airline is interested in making money by cramming more seats.,no
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Rishad Patell,8th January 2013,BOM-DEL-BOM. Early morning departure from Bombay was on time and a good flight. Very full both ways. Good check in services and very courteous staff. Good airline to fly domestic.,yes
IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,V Bagaria,8th January 2013,Flew Kolkata-Bangalore via Chennai. Flight departed on time the aircraft despite being one of their older ones was clean and well-maintained. The crew were simply superb. Though the catering onboard should improve.

IndiGo,10,IndiGo customer review,V Agarwal,8th January 2013,"COK-BOM. Check in at Cochin a breeze no queue at all. A320 was clean and modern. The flight attendants were active and friendly. on and arrived on time. In Mumbai the bags were out in ten minutes. Indigo made flying fun from Cabin Crew with their Leading Lady and Miss Indigo badges the aircraft steps had painted on the side ""Here comes the hot stepper"". The sandwiches to purchase in a box that said ""airwich"" even the cashew nuts came in a collectable tin which said ""Nut Case"" on it.",yes
IndiGo,9,IndiGo customer review,Ameya Chitre,8th January 2013,BOM-BDQ on A320. Check-in was not as efficient as I have know Indigo to have. But it was not a problem.

IndiGo,7,IndiGo customer review,Saketh Rahm,8th January 2013,Overall a good experience from HYD-BLR-HYD and HYD-DEL. Planes are new and modern crew all young pleasant and helpful and speak perfect English. Seating is very tight - the person in from of me reclined their seat and it was in my face. They sell food which is tasty and well priced. One major negative as at check in at HYD. My company bought my ticket in the US and they asked me to produce the credit card. As I could not they denied me boarding until I bought another ticket which was very frustrating and almost caused me to miss the flight. They gave me an email print out for a refund but this is certainly not up to international standards.,yes

The crew was unprofessional, unhelpful, and lacked basic courtesy. Lack of information regarding flight delays, boarding, and other essential updates. No assistance provided for damaged seats or basic amenities. Charged ₹2400 for being 1 minute late for boarding, despite a long queue. This policy seems unfair and exploitative. Seats were damaged and uncomfortable. Long queues and inefficient boarding process.  Overall, a poorly managed and chaotic experience.  Avoid flying with SpiceJet unless absolutely necessary.",no

I am very disappointed to state that on both occasions the flights were more than 6 hours delayed. The return flight was delayed by 10 hours. There was no apology from the airline or even offer for some water and snacks. In addition, the aircraft interiors were dirty, smelly and on both flights the air-conditioning was not working till we took off. I can assure you that I and my friends and colleagues will never travel by SpiceJet again.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""only sends automated emails""",Sachin Atri,23rd September 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   Spicejet justifies the tag of being a budget airline! So much so that it does not believe in giving boarding passes online either. A customer could keep doing web check in without receiving the boarding pass or an email confirming the same. The customer service only sends automated emails. Whoever you email to, the response is an immediate auto response email. And the icing on the cake is that, their flights, a day before, get delayed and the reason cited is ""operatonal"" and one could keep guessing what that possibly means. And this experience is even before a customer has taken the flight!",no

They were incredibly attentive, always ensuring that every passenger was comfortable and well taken care of.

I would have given a minus rating if there was an option.,no
SpiceJet,1,“Worst ever domestic airline”,Kamal Dhama,23rd September 2024,✅ Trip Verified | Worst ever domestic airline in India currently. Their flights are always delayed for 3-4 hours and their support staff always comes with strange and poor reasons. They don’t care about their passengers. They make them wait for long hours without providing them the actual timings. They don’t even compensate for their delays. They offer a refund if a flight is delayed by 3 hours which is useless anyways because you have to book another flight for you on the spot which costs you double the amount and you are already late. Their support staff is not even bothered to help and guide their passengers. Inside the flight you won’t even get a 250ml water bottle. If you request then only you will be given half of glass water only.,no

We had to change plans and go to Delhi to look for them. They promised us they would send them and they didn't, they hung up on us, they didn't answer emails and most of the contact numbers don't work. More than 5 days without clothes, charger, medicine... and today it is impossible for us to claim anything, they tell us that they are not responsible. Several days wasted on calls and half an afternoon at the airport trying to claim and we left without getting anything. Jamás viajes con esta compañía. Nos perdieron las maletas en un vuelo de una hora (directamente no las subieron al avión) además de salir con un retraso de más de 3 horas, una de las cuales nos tuvieron sentados en el avión sin aire acondicionado (estábamos a más de 30 grados) Las maletas jamás nos las mandaron a nuestro siguiente destino. Tuvimos que cambiar planes e ir a Delhi a buscarlas. Nos prometían que las mandaban y no lo hacían, nos colgaban el teléfono, no contestaban a los emails y la mayoría de los números de contacto no funcionan. Más de 5 días sin ropa, cargador, medicinas...y a día de hoy nos es imposible reclamar nada, nos dicen que no se responsabilizan.

On the Last stretch for around 45 minutes we were asked to put Seatbelts on due to constant Turbulence & all passengers were frightened. But the Pilot & the crew kept very calm & composed and Pilot also sounded very confident assuring us with his regular announcements although being a frequent flyer I knew this was very unusual weather disturbance. Later came to know that many flights were diverted from Delhi that time as there was constant heavy downpour but our Pilot landed the flight very smoothly and with minimum delay.",yes
SpiceJet,2,“the same with all SpiceJet flights”,Victor Bordoloi,10th August 2024,✅ Trip Verified | Boarding call was announced and all passengers were asked to queue after which boarding was not started for next 45mins.

SpiceJet,1,"""not recommend this airline """,Sanath Kumar,22nd June 2024,✅ Trip Verified |  The flight got delayed indefinitely and the airline people didn’t even bother to announce the delay and no refreshment was provided to the elders and children leave alone adults. While asked they gave a senseless response and this is because the flight is the only available carrier in that particular route. Though I did not raise this issue immediately and I was a spicemax customer this is silly and unpardonable . I Would not recommend this airline to any of my friends,no
SpiceJet,1,"""ask you to weigh you handbag""",Aaditya Gupta,22nd June 2024,✅ Trip Verified |  The absolute worst airline.

If you communicate that you haven’t checked in any bag then they also do not listen. They are also not allowing you to shift the bag to check in baggage by saying that time is over.

The staff refused to let me board without paying Rs. 1,800/- for extra weight. I tried to convince saying I dont have a check in luggage. Please understand that it is a trap. They know very well that we cannot go and check in our luggage even if we want to because boarding has already started and it is less than an hour of departure. This is done intentionally to fleece the regular travellers who do not bother to check in a briefcase. Finally I had to pay 1,800/- or I had to miss the flight.",no

SpiceJet,1,"""Spicejet was bad""",R Varson,22nd June 2024,"✅ Trip Verified |   Everyone knows the reputation spicejet has. I chose to ignore it and had booked a round trip with spicejet Hyderabad - Chennai. On my flight to Chennai, I had a terrible experience. The flight was already delayed by an hour. I did not have a checkin bag, and only had cabin. I was asked to pay 1800rs extra for my laptop bag. I've never faced this with any other airline. They waited for the flight checkin to close to start checking the bags. I was forced to pay the full amount, but they gave a discount for the passenger who came after me. The flying experience was not good, a bathroom door that kept making noise in the air - it was loose I guess. It's really surprising that spicejet is still operating. Coming to my return flight (at 8:45am), I was hoping it would be smooth. But again, just at the time of checking in my baggage (7:35am), I get message that the flight has been rescheduled to 12noon. Upon checking with the staff they said the flight was supposed to come from Ahmedabad to Chennai, before going to Hyderabad, but due to technical reasons got sent back mid way. Even the 12noon was just an estimate and it can get delayed further. There was no other airline having a flight earlier than that too. And obviously now with higher prices since it's last minute. But anyways I took this as a punishment for booking Spicejet. Took a full refund (which is pennies compared to the fare of my new booking and the cab from and to the airport again) and booked with a different airline. I chose to ignore the other reviews, I hope you don't. Spicejet was bad, is bad and will be bad.",no

Despite reporting the issue immediately upon arrival, I was disappointed with the lack of action taken by the airline to address the situation. Upon landing, I promptly notified SpiceJet staff about the missing luggage, providing all necessary details. However, I was dismayed by the lack of communication and follow-up from the airline regarding the status of my luggage. As a customer, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can occur, but it's essential for airlines to prioritize customer service and take proactive steps to resolve such issues. Unfortunately, my experience with SpiceJet fell short in this regard. I urge SpiceJet to improve its baggage handling procedures and enhance communication with passengers regarding luggage issues. It's crucial for airlines to demonstrate accountability and provide timely updates to affected customers. I hope that by sharing my experience, SpiceJet will take necessary steps to address the underlying issues and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.",no

SpiceJet,1,“they refused to take responsibility”,S Chatterjee,11th March 2024,"✅ Trip Verified | SpiceJet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience. Traveling with my family, a total of six individuals, we embarked on a journey from Amritsar (ATQ), India to DXB (Dubai) on February 24, 2024. The scheduled departure time was 08:40 AM, with a connecting flight from Dubai to London Heathrow at 14:30 Hrs via Emirates. Our ticket was booked through the booking.com portal as a single ticket, rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection. However, our experience with SpiceJet quickly turned sour. Departing from ATQ, the flight was delayed by 55 minutes. Upon arrival in Dubai, we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation. Initially, we were given excuses regarding weather conditions, despite the clear and sunny day in Dubai, and optimal weather conditions for take-off. Eventually, a member of the ground staff revealed the truth - the delay was due to SpiceJet's scheduling issues and the busy nature of Dubai airport. This delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to London Heathrow. Expecting assistance from SpiceJet, we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution. However, to our dismay, they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions. Their staff was unhelpful and dismissive, leaving us stranded in Dubai with our children. Consequently, we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the UK. I feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airline's deceptive practices. SpiceJet's lack of accountability and disregard for customer welfare make them a company to avoid at all costs.",no

When I called Dubai branch they told me its in Mumbai, so no one is actually taking the responsibility, after 5 long hours of wait in the airport I lost my temper and as soon as I started to shout one SpiceJet staff approached me and said ""Sir your luggage is here but as there are too many of them from other passengers as well its hard to find"". After this I started to shout and there were a lot of passenger's who were there for the exact same reason joined me when they saw this happening they called me and said my luggage is found in the warehouse and will be here by any moment, and after 10-15 minutes my luggage arrived and I couldn't even recognize my bag as it was completely trashed.",no

We rushed to the airport late evening of 12.01.24, only to find flight was delayed multiple times. Finally it took off at 8.45 am only. Staff were least bothered about passengers convenience and they were very rude in their approach. Not even tea/coffee was offered for inordinate delay. Breakfast was given after umpteen requests from aggrieved flyers at around 7.30 pm for which we had to stand in long queue. I sincerely suggest never ever to book SpiceJet flight.

SpiceJet,1,"""Do not book Spicejet flights""",APURVA Sanghvi,25th January 2024,✅ Trip Verified |  Nightmare experience with a toddler. We booked a direct flight from Mumbai to Jaisalmer with SpiceJet in June for the Xmas holidays. Come a week before the flight SpiceJet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in Delhi and 10 hour layover options. At such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund. We wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover. This was denied too. They held on to our money for 6 months before doing this. This is not where the ordeal ends. The first flight was delayed. Sat on the runway for over an hour before take off. We had to rush and change terminals. We were assured that our suitcases would reach Jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff. They did not. We were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in Jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day. We were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family. We asked them to reimburse this amount too. They did not. We asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu. They did not have it. Do not book Spicejet flights even if you’re getting them for free.

Despite daily calls to their customer service, there has been zero progress. The only consistent thing I've received from SpiceJet is false promises that I will get the revert on mail within 6 hours. It's been a month, and I'm still waiting for a revert mail. This lack of responsiveness and accountability is unacceptable. I expected better service, especially in handling situations involving significant delays. If you value your time and money, think twice before choosing SpiceJet.

Unfortunately, the flight experienced multiple delays: first pushed to 8 am, then further delayed to 10:50 am, 11 am, and finally 12:15 pm. These continuous delays were quite challenging for us, significantly disrupting our schedule. The airline's inefficiency led to a waste of our precious time. When we requested lounge access due to the prolonged delay, the airline offered a meal instead. There were murmurs among passengers about SpiceJet's limited staffing and flights, suggesting that they might be playing games with travelers. Overall, the lack of support and the series of delays left us deeply dissatisfied.

My flight, which was scheduled to depart at 10:20 pm, was originally changed to 1:55 am, extended to 4:10 am, and then delayed again to 4:40am while I was at the airport. Being a professional with a demanding schedule, I trusted and reserved this flight to have surgery the next morning. Please consider other airlines before making a commitment with Spicejet.

The time of delay is never communicated. The duration of delay can ever extend. And the biggest issue is that they won't ever approach or be available to address the concerns of the passengers. The response to why the delay happened will be so technical that you will wish to not have asked for it. The staff is rude and arrogant.

Departure was smooth and as this was an overnight flight the cabin lights were dimmed for most of the flight. Descent and landing were on time followed by a swift luggage retrieval.

SpiceJet has  a weighing machine at the entrance to check the weight of each passenger's hand luggage and they enforce a strict 7 kg limit. If you exceed this limit, you are charged a70 AED per kg. This situation is unacceptable and amounts to nothing less than exploitation of passengers who choose SpiceJet for budget-friendly fares.

SpiceJet,5,"""a decent functional experience""",S Harshun,1st November 2023,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I had taken this evening flight to Calcutta, during the web check-in, I had opted for the random seat selection for which there would be no charges applied as I was travelling solo, so before 12 hours of the departure, I had received the seat. Check-in was done at the old T1 terminal at BOM where baggage drop was done swiftly as there was no line and queues which was surprising. The boarding started on time however I noticed that when I was about to greet the crew there were 2 crew members who were not really greeting any of the passengers and seem surprised that I wished them good evening when they reciprocated. Ideally greeting the passengers is something that should be standard. Also I noticed that the load on this flight was on the lighter side as well however due to the ATC clearances the actual pushback and departure was delayed by over 1 hour but this was not on the airline. The pilots did a good job of keeping the passengers updated about the reasons for the delay. The flight itself was operated on one of those Boeing 737-800NG aircraft that was painted in the erstwhile JetConnect liveries. The pilots tried to make the time en route on the flight and was able to retrieve my luggage soon without waiting too long. While Spicejet has been going through a lot of difficulties in recent times, and that was also reflected in the manner in which the crew seemed disinterested in greeting the passengers, there are still small things that the airline can do which can still make a small difference to the passenger experience because otherwise for the fare that was paid this was a decent functional experience that was able to get me safely to my destination.",yes

Such conduct from Spicejet was very unprofessional and dissatisfactory. When a customer pays the ticket price, he owns the right to travel through the flight and taking away this right is illegal in all terms. I cannot understand if there is a policy of spicejet to charge amounts for a laptop bag, what made the team cancel my onboarding on the request of adding these 2 words - ""Laptop Bag"" on the excess baggage charge payment receipt. To my utmost surprise, when I raised this with Spicejet, they are saying that I have only refused to travel and they did not deny onboarding. This is completely false, as any sensible person can vouch for it - if I would have to refuse travel I would not have even paid the excess baggage charges in the first instance. This is a pure betrayal from spicejet. At least, they should have the guts to accept what they did. They have even refused to refund the ticket price.",no

We were supposed to land at 7:20 but we landed at 8.

My recent journey with SpiceJet from Calicut to Dubai was a complete disappointment. The check-in process was marred by unprofessional behavior from the staff. We encountered an unfortunate experience with the staff, who displayed aggression and utter disrespect towards passengers. Adding to the distress, the staff demanded an exorbitant additional charge for our luggage, including an unreasonable claim for my baby's stroller, which we had previously taken on the same route without any problems during our outbound flight. This inconsistency and unjustified charge left us deeply dissatisfied. Despite providing proof of double payment, SpiceJet is yet to refund the excessive amount they charged us under duress. It is disheartening to see an airline of this stature failing to provide basic customer satisfaction. I sincerely hope Spice Jet takes immediate action and thoroughly trains their staff to treat passengers with respect and empathy.

Now 2 days back I received an SMS from SpiceJet that the flight has been cancelled and there is no alternative flight available. I spoke to SpiceJet agent and requested them to arrange a flight for me on another carrier which is Indigo on which I was told that I need to write to higher authorities. This is plainly making a fool out of the customer as now the only direct flight which is available is Indigo and is more than double the price I paid for SpiceJet flight booked in advance. SpiceJet always does this with their customers. If they are unable to operate they should shut down operations but shouldn’t cheat the customers.

We had no choice as other airline flights were not available for 3 people or exorbitantly expensive. We had to continue and checked in. The flight was delayed from scheduled 23.30 hrs on 21st May to 00.45am on 22nd May. We have landed on T2 terminal at 4.20am. We have lost sleep, money and an entire of work day pre travel and post travel. We have barely slept. They have offered a sandwich and Rajma Chawl at the airport. It is a hardship which we will never forget and not recommend SpiceJet to anyone. The leg space between the chair is extremely low. An average height person like us was hitting knee to the seat ahead. Extremely bad experience both ways. There was no courtesy shown to us by SpiceJet ground staff and cabin crew.

With that the gate number changed for 44 to 76, travelling with aged people it is so difficult to change gates. When given a certain time for a flight going abroad, the airline is supposed to take care on everything the passengers have planned. Other than a bit of food compensation the SpiceJet staff has not been helpful what do ever.

SpiceJet,5,"""the service was what was expected""",Ashish Varun,25th March 2023,"✅ Trip Verified | I had booked this flight a month before flying as it came at a very cheap and reasonable rate. The web check in for the flight was fine and I had opted for the auto seat selection without getting charged a fare for seat selection. So the boarding pass was given to me 12 hours before departure. The check in and baggage drop was smooth. The boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route. Noted that I was flying on a 737 Max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated. Also the plane was much quieter. However when boarding, most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual. Also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket, the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary. The safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin. It felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through. Perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment. It is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named SpiceScreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge. It had a decent selection of movies / podcasts / magazines which was much appreciated. The flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately. On the whole, for the cheap fare that was paid, the service was what was expected and it's true that even though the airline is going through challenges, there are definitely aspects that should be taken care of.",yes

You will never find a more boorish, crude and unreasonable airline like them, they kept me at Mumbai Airport for almost 10 hrs, no remorse even for our loss, the important meeting I missed, the expenses I had to endure in these 10 hrs in the airport and complete wastage of time.

I want my money right now in 1 day in fact in 5 minutes the way you looted it while SpiceJet looted it while they gave an illusion for a service.

I have taken a return trip flight with SpiceJet and both the times the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours. No communication was sent by the airline. When I asked one of assistant boarding staff to give the email ID of their supervisor, she clearly said that she don’t know the ID and during the flight the cabin crew were not co-operative. SpiceJet is very frequent in news for their delays and flight issues, still no actions are taken from their side. I think the Managing Director and his team should look into this or else SpiceJet should restrict their business to India and close their international flights.",no

The flight was announced with delay and there is nothing you can do. They mention to you one hour delay so that you don’t freak out but at the end you don’t know when you are flying. On top of that you as very rude staff that really doesn’t care about customer satisfaction. If you ask to be booked on an earlier flight even with another airline they laugh at you.

Two days before boarding the flight I contacted SpiceJet customer care to ask about luggage. Allowed weight for infant because it was not mentioned in the ticket. SpiceJet is basically playing with their terms and conditions and incorrectly charging the customer. I was told to go to the link https://corporate.spicejet.com/tnc.aspx point number 14 where it says that passenger travelling with infant are allowed to query 7 kg extra but the lady on the boarding counter clearly that the terms and condition of SpiceJet has been updated and their customer care is not aware about it. The terms and condition now is that mother travelling alone will be allowed 7 kg extra. It seems but they are making their own policy standing on the counter and she told me if I don't pay this amount she will put my luggage back outside the counter. I was forced to pay extra for 3 kg although I was in weight limits what was told to me by customer care of SpiceJet and whatever it was told to me on the board accountable was completely incorrect and not mentioned anywhere in the terms and condition of SpiceJet. It seems that the employees of SpiceJet just play with the customers by making their own terms and conditions on basis of their assumptions.

First and foremost, the airline added a stop (Jabalpur) at the last moment without seeking any consent from the traveller. I booked my flight for 8th June 2022, non-stop from Mumbai to Chennai. Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldn’t take a 5 hours since SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option, I had to shift my journey date to 9th June. Reached airport and there started another another round of drama. Ill mannered, rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wife’s health, the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health. Me, my wife and my 3 year old son- we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time, that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement. At last, I had to request my fellow passengers to change the seats (they were kind enough to accept my request). Highly unprofessional, rude and arrogant cabin crew.

SpiceJet,1,"""There is absolutely no empathy for the customer""",S Laghari,11th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | SpiceJet has horrible service and reschedules the flight without thinking about the convenience of its customers. I had booked an early morning direct flight from Hyderabad to Delhi which takes about 2.5/3 hours as I had whole day program in Jabalpur. It rerouted the flight through Delhi with a stopover at Delhi for 8 hours making me miss the whole of the day program. Now a couple of hours before the flight time which was to start at 5 pm, it has further delayed the flight by 5 hours making me miss the evening program also. This has happened with Delhi to Jabalpur flight in January 2019 as well when they postponed the flight by 7 hours. Why would anyone book a early morning unless one has some work during the day. SpiceJet has ruined the whole program I had, morning as well as evening, not only at Jabalpur but also at my base location because I had not planned any work due to upcoming travel.

SpiceJet,1,"""There was utter confusion and no clarity""",Sunil Kumar Khetarpal,11th June 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | SG 953 on 19/5/2022 Delhi Terminal 1 to Shirdi International Terminal. The flight was scheduled to land at Shirdi at 4.50pm. Instead, the flight landed at Mumbai at 5.30pm. Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money. I had already blacklisted SpiceJet earlier because of their poor service.. No wonder SpiceJet is on the verge of collapse and shutting down looking at their quality of staff, meals, aircraft and service. A complete failure of structure, process and outcome indicators.",no

I kept requesting them if not refund then at least give me validity extension cause I won't be able to travel for another 10 months.

Wait time at airport was extremely long for the flight to take off. To my surprise I did not receive my bag at the airport for such a short flight and no transit in between I have an important function to attend tomorrow and there is perishable stuff in the suitcase. SpiceJet service and handling has spoiled my entire trip and left me in very difficult situation. I just called their customer care number.

How can an airline be so ignorant to the travellers since we are the reason you guys have business. My cancelled flight was almost full, and they could have simply scheduled another flight for the next day. But they are now giving us indirect flights at the charge of direct flights which is generally higher. The staff was lying to the crowd that the direct flights are cancelled and giving us indirect flights. And at the same time, they were taking a few passengers to the side and booking them on direct flights.

As per notification, we (including other passengers) were at Gate # 21. At the last moment (around 11.00 am) the ground staff came and informed us that the Gate was changed to 106. When we reached Gate # 106, we were informed that the Gate was closed and boarding can not be allowed. On argument, we were allowed boarding. The ground staff were abusive saying ""Are you illiterate?"" and ""I am doing Ehshaan (favour) by allowing you all to board"". I have never experienced such issue any time in the past. Very bad handling by the ground staff of SpiceJet.",no

SpiceJet cancelled the Flight. I cancelled my tickets on 22-Aug-2021 when received the Flight cancellation message and opted for full refund. Even after 26 days, I have not got the refund. The customer care initially told that it will take 15 days to get the refund. 15 days withholding the money for cancelling the Flight for their own benefit (other 2 airlines were operating on the same day, same route, same timing) shows their commitment to the customers. The worst part is even after 15 days no refund received.  Even after 26 days the refund is not received.",no

So Chennai to Mumbai and Mumbai to Goa. The waiting time in Mumbai is 6+ hours. I wrote to customer relations, asking them, since there is no alternate flights available, its our daughters first birthday and she was so nagging and I requested them atleast provide a lounge or room considering the infant as it is 6+ hours. I got no response for that until 12th September. When you call customer care, one have to nearly wait 40+ minutes to speak to respective person in-charge. Again, via return, the direct flight has been cancelled. We took a flight from Goa to Bangalore and Bangalore to Chennai with 3+ hours waiting time in Bangalore.  There was a time change again, from Goa to Bangalore and we re-booked our cab. We had a very worst experience with Spicejet. All they say, the change is due to operational reasons.

Cabin crew is cooperative and addresses the passenger needs. Seats are not comfortable and inadequate leg space. Airline has adequate airline menu but pre booking is costlier than on board purchase.

No information at the time of deboarding. We are running all over Delhi T3 catching hold of random Spicejet employees and seeking help. How could they leave without passengers who were already issued boarding pass? Why did they not assign somebody to take care of us when we alighted in transit at Delhi T3. Worst is that they kept offering refund to passengers who are in transit. Finally they put us on the next days flight which again we had to insist upon. Harrowing journey and unpleasant service by airport staff of Spicejet at Delhi T3.",no

Also the layover time got extended to 19 hours instead of 11 hours, which previously was a layover of 2.5 hours. I would never recommend SpiceJet to anyone. They simply harassed me like anything. I am sitting in Mumbai airport with no lounge access as they won't allow me to enter arrivals, have to wait throughout the night because of their so called ""operational reasons"".

And in actual the takeoff happened at 12:50 PM and arrival at Bangalore happened at 4:15 PM! Worst part is : I reached airport at 8 AM and at 8:15 I received a notification that the time changed to 10:15 I waited for an hour and then I receive a notification that the time changes to 10:35 After 30 minutes of more wait I get notification that time changes to 11:35 And then finally after one hour I receive a notification that the updated time is 12:05 PM. SpiceJet team is so unprofessional that they kept on changing time within an hours difference and this happened 4 times for the same flight.

Had to move to this week, amending my entire schedule because SpiceJet unilaterally decided I didn't need to be in Chennai that day/week and just told me I was going when they could make it happen. Rescheduled my trip for this week, rearranged by booking and now they have amended once and cancelled once. Suggest that anyone that needs to work to a schedule should give this lot a wide berth.

I wish there would have 0 star rating to give because they don't even deserve 1 star. They changed our flight timings at first due to which we had to change our other events timimg. Later on airport our baggage was not loaded. We had to wait 2 to 3 days to have our baggage. They were not even sorry for the same and the airport staff was very rude to help us in that situation. As a part of compensation they promised us 1500 voucher written on the attachment top. But still not received it. Even after several calls and emails they are not replying anything on the voucher status.. Not answering the calls either. Dont know why they charge so much money for such a worst service. I will never recommend using Spicejet ever to anyone. I had a worst experience ever with the airport staff. And due to no great response from customer service i believe this airlines is not a price worthy. Better use other airlines than spicejet.,no

More than 15 months later we are still waiting for that refund. SpiceJet's charter states refunds are issued within 7 days if purchased tickets by credit card. The Supreme Court of India ruled that Spicejet must pay out refunds by 31st March 2021. SpiceJet are in in serious breach of contact and legal ruling. For the last 15 months we have been in contact with SpiceJet's consumer relations, nodal officer and appellate.",no

Asked to refund to take alternate flight and asked who will pay for stay and food, They refused to refund the ticket amount, they suggest to cancel the ticket but told cancellation charge will applicable.

Their response in this manner was totally abnormal.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""I had to spent an entire night at the airport""",Pragya Mishra,23rd August 2021,"Not Verified |  SpiceJet is the most pathetic airline service out of all available services in India.

Just don't go for SpiceJet if you have any other options available.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""staff is very unprofessional and arrogant""",V Pakaran,23rd August 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Their ground staff is very unprofessional and arrogant. I observed that hand baggage weight limit policy of 7kg is applied to only certain customers. I have been waiting in the que for boarding and in front of me many customers gone with higher weight and in my turn I had 2 kg extra and I have been instructed to pay 60Dhs per kg for excess weight. I honour their terms and conditions but my question is that the policy should be uniform to all customers. I don’t understand the logic behind different terms according to the face value of customers. They are favouring some customers according to their wish and relaxed for more than 10kg. When I tried to ask this to their ground staff, they were so arrogant and impatient. They kicked me out from the que and rudely told if you don’t want to pay throw your item. I have been travelling in this sector for past 17 years and used many carriers. Never experienced such behavior earlier. When I entered the flight, again surprising that there is no space to keep my hand baggage. They have collected such a heavy amount and I had to keep that items below my seat compromising leg space.  When I shared my experience to their customer service team later, they come up with copy paste of standard reply format justifying their terms. Be aware about their standard so that you will not have disappointment.",no

With regards to what I can carry and what I can't carry also guided me in check-in and hand luggage which made me really feel at ease as I was a single lady passenger and with the pandemic situation so I was scared and all. Apart from that I really loved him for his excellent communication skills, open-minded and friendliness, his professionalism, his passion for his work, excellent work ethic, courtesy, his manners, friendliness and open-minded attitude towards cultural awareness and he knows how to treat a passenger like a guest in his own home with respect without any discrimination unlike what I saw at Mumbai airport how poor people are treated. He also had put priority and transfer tag on my luggage so it gets loaded separately as promised by him, excited to see the bag come out 1st and that was very sweet of him. He is an excellent example of what customer service is. Though he didn't do my check in he has left a mark on me and he is the reason I wish to fly with Spicejet again and see more staff like him and his excellent habits",yes

When I reached at the gate, I saw almost everyone with so much of luggage and I happened to ask a female who was carrying the same combination of hand luggage as mine. She said she did not pay for any extra luggage. It was visible that so many of the travellers were carrying more than one bag of hand luggage.

Proper behaviour, patience, and hospitality! Perfect example of how a crew should be.

We pleaded with to them but their attitude was so rude. After pleading for 20 mins they gave us boarding passes because we had already done online check in. After all this drama I finally boarded the flight 15 mins early, if they haven’t made this an issue I would have boarded half an hour earlier. I really recommend to please learn hospitality from other airlines, I also travelled with Vistara, Indigo, GoAir and Air India, if their customers are late they actually look for you and make you board the flight without making it an issue.

However we would like to draw your attention to one of the bad incidents. Our seats were 3A and 3B and entered the flight almost at the end of the boarding process. We were trying to accommodate our hand baggage within the available space within the overhead compartment. In between one person occupying seat 1F started shouting us not to touch his bags! We were thinking that it is a crazy passenger but later on found from the crew that it is the captain of Spicejet. It was a shocking moment and we have never came across such an arrogant airline staff, whether national OR international carrier. We are not able to understand how can Spicejet afford such a bad person as your captain especially during this COVID season. We tried to complain to the crew but it was of no use since the captain is above all of them.",yes
SpiceJet,1,"""Worst experience ever""",F Elach,29th January 2021,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. I was travelling alone with my one year old daughter. I had planned to checkin my stroller and the hand luggages along with others since i was alone. I've done this with many other airlines in similar situations. However, today was a nightmare. Apparently i had to pay for checking in the above mentioned or carry them all with me. I was utterly shocked of the lady at the counter for behaving in such a rude way. She told me to open the stroller and take it back. So i had to carry the 7kg hand luggage of my baby, 7kg hand luggage of mine and my daughter with the stroller in my hand. And by the time I reached the plane i was truly exhausted. I had back ache and plane was hot. It had only paid food and the seating wasn't comfortable either. What is the point in paying for the infant if they don't have a seat, luggage allowance or food. The plane got delayed, I was starving and tired. And when I got off the plane the stroller wasn't there.  I had to wait for the stroller after I've received all my suitcases. So what was the point in making me suffer if it all went in the same plane. Worst experience ever. Never choosing this airline ever again.",no
SpiceJet,2,"""Delay due to bad weather""",Abhishek Dey,29th January 2021,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delay due to bad weather conditions.

SpiceJet,1,"""No word to explain how unsatisfied I am""",Parimal Santra,8th December 2020,Not Verified |  I booked the ticket but yet to fly. This would be my first Travel in spicejet. But suddenly got a message that the ticket has been changed to next day. That means 24hrs delay. They given 2 contact numbers but when I call those numbers it shows busy most of the time. When I able to connect it says Your call is important to us and waiting time is 60 min. Is this a joke!! So basically I needed to look for other options but unable to reach airlines. I don’t think airline can imagine the situation. No word to explain how unsatisfied I am.,no
SpiceJet,1,"""I am not at all satisfied""",N Garshan,8th December 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my experience with SpiceJet and I am not at all satisfied with the services provided.  First of all booking page says that it's a non stop flight of duration of 4:20hrs but it's not. (BLR-DEL) Secondly return flight was of 4:20hrs (says non-stop) but it's not. It's via Pune and now the halt has been increased from 30min to 6hrs. There is no use of utilising flight as it's wasting my whole day with a halt of 6hrs. Now while cancelling this return ticket of around Rs 4.2K, te refund amount calculated is just Rs 572. So it's like I had money and I have wasted this with SpiceJet. Kindly review your service and enhance the customer service/booking interface or at least provide clarity to customers. Please don't lie. If there was an option to reveiew SpiceJet in negative, I would have done that without a second thought.",no

I booked a Spice Max ticket and I was offered a vegetarian meal. I asked her if I could exchange it with a non vegetarian meal. She apologized saying there was no non veg option on my ticket. However she tried her best to look if there was non available with her crew member at the back. Unfortunately there was not. She came back to me and offered a few munchies for which I denied. What really impressed me was, she truly was concerned about me being hungry and she offered me her meal saying sir I can offer you my meal, please have it. This gesture of hers made my day. I never expected such care and warmth, she was very grounded and so real, not like she was doing her job. I was treated like a guest and not a mere passenger, she was kind and kept checking if I was really okay, I was truly moved. This was one of my best experiences of customer service in India.",yes

Flight was hosted with two capable and highly professional set of crews Miss Disha and Miss Mary.  Water is not served in a organised manner and some passengers are left. But here distribution was organised. The night before boarding the Flight at CCU I had a minor Fracture a in my ankle so i had removed the shoes during sitting as it was very Painful. After Landing staff assisted me to tie my bandages around and wear my shoes. She wore a Pair of Gloves sprayed sanitisers on the shoes and helped me tie the laces. Social distancing was maintained in the Flight. Prior to this I had a bad experience with Spicejet that was in 2019. After that I never choose Spicejet. Due to some condition I had to choose spicejet. After this recent flight I can feel the difference clearly that spicejet has kept professional crews on board.,yes
SpiceJet,10,"""I was so pleased with the hospitality that the aircrew exhibited""",Jereena Babu Vanpuzha,6th November 2020,"✅ Trip Verified | I am a traveler who took the flight SG140 from Calicut to Dubai. I had to draft this mail because I was so pleased with the hospitality that the aircrew exhibited. The air hosts and air hostesses were very kind and pleasant in their communication with passengers. Also to note was how they kept the washroom sanitized after every five passengers had accessed it. I personally had a very bad headache that day and they helped me overcome that by providing excellent service. They were very polite (although I know it is their job). The steward was very kind to first ask me if I had taken food before getting me a pill and lukewarm water (this matters because medicines have to be taken after food and with lukewarm water and not every flight steward/stewardess bothers to make sure if the passenger has eaten something and if the temperature of the water is right). After this, the stewardess approached me a second time to enquire if I was doing okay and if I needed something which I thought was a very sweet and generous gesture from their side and I was so satisfied and happy because I had never received that kind of treatment on any flight before. I know it is the job of an air host/hostess to attend to the passengers, but to date, on every flight I've been to, none of them have come back to enquire about my health after attending to me once. This gesture, even though it was small, made me feel so contented and I'm pleased to have had the chance to be a passenger on board this flight. Thank you SpiceJet and thank you cabin crew of SG140.",yes

SpiceJet,1,"""They are the worst customer service""",B Amari,4th October 2020,"✅ Trip Verified | Airline cancelled flight due to schedule change (timing of flights did not fall with the Corona mandated closure of airspace), and airline refused to provided a refund despite clearly stated in their T&Cs and know your customer rights for civil air passengers that they must provide either a credit note or a refund according to the customers wishes. Then they decided to only provide a credit shell for the outgoing flight, not the return flight (no airline cancels an outgoing flight but keeps the return flight - completely against all procedures), finally they added a credit note that is not even valid for a year. When we tried to use the credit note, however it was not possible to apply the note on an online booking, all helpline numbers for the company are not active, and no one replied to an email sent requesting immediate assistance. They are the worst customer service, I would never ever fly with them, they do not adhere to their own guidelines nor to the civil aviation customer rights.",no
SpiceJet,10,"""smooth and quick process""",T Reddy,4th October 2020,✅ Trip Verified | Overall good experience.

I traveled from United States to India with two check-in bags and week later I booked a domestic flight in Spicejet. Ticket cost INR 6000+ and also I purchased extra baggage allowance for my 2nd check-in that cost INR 12000+ and total cost is INR18205. Little did I know that I am not qualified to carry my 2nd check-in that cost INR12000. So I contacted customer service and apparently it's not refundable. So I asked them cancel the entire ticket and cancellation charge cost INR4000 even though I purchased their own so called insurance. Their check-in baggage allowance weight is 20kg (44lbs) which is the least of least of airlines I flew so far. I am a very frequent flyer and have been flying from last 15 years in western countries and never ever this happened in any other airlines. These fares are totally unreasonable even for western standards for a 50 mins flight. Come on Spicejet, you can do way better.",no

But now after 3rd failure, when I called them and ask my money back so first they says it not their policy and they will keep money as credit shell. But after long talk they gave me assurance for return the money. But it was all just a joke. Also, their CS team gives misinformation and I filed a complaint twice to them.

SpiceJet,1,"""the worst Airline""",Karan Sharma,4th October 2020,Not Verified |  SpiceJet is the worst Airline. Once the payment is done' they do not care about it's customers. I have been mailing them for weeks trying to contact them to cancel my flight or at least reschedule it but they are not responding at all. The customer care staff is the worst they do not really care about their customers at all. All that matters is money. Once the payment is done they do not care about anybody. Even at this time when the world is fighting Corona they expect me to either board in the flight else I will be refunded on 380 rupees for tickets costing 16000. In case I want to reschedule my flight I will have to pay rupees 3000 per passenger which is illogical. They keep telling us their policies which I believe are not for such epidemic situations.

There is no way to cancel a booking through their web site, and their phone numbers only worked once out of the 30+ times I tried them!

SpiceJet,1,"""horrible customer care""",A Postma,17th March 2020,Not Verified |  Colombo to Chennai via Mumbai. The main reason for reviewing SpiceJet is their horrible customer care and their way of communicating. So we tried booking on their website but after payment their website didn't work and we didn't receive the tickets. After calling and emailing for at least 20 times the past month they keep asking the same questions without any progress. We're still waiting for our money back.

I usually fly spicemax most of the time to have convenience and to save time but that generally doesn't happen. I have tried to provide feedback multiple times through their portal about their spicemax program but mostly it seems they are least bothered about customer feedback or customer satisfaction. Almost 90% of the time spicemax doesn't mean anything for SpiceJet crew. I believe their crew lacks proper training or they don't care for people onboard. I believe they should focus to make this program more robust so that people would feel like paying for the additional facilities. If they treat the same to all than why would one pay the premium to avail additional services.,no

The dinner was pre-booked consisting of tawa fish and daal with rice. During the check in all the luggages were checked in a proper manner. However, there was a delay of around 45 mins or so. The seats were comfortable enough for a 2 hour 40 minute journey. The service on-board was quite nice and the crew were attentive. The pre flight meal was also quite nice and also had a plum cake and yogurt for dessert. We landed at Mumbai 1 hour after the scheduled arrival time, but the delay was of little consequence. The baggage was retrieved  swiftly from the baggage belt. Apart from the delay this was a pretty good flight.",yes

Our return flight time was 5:25 am and we reached the airport at 4:45. We were declined boarding passes because they said we need to arrive 45 mins prior and despite of begging the staff to give us our boarding passes they were rude.  We were told that they had already started boarding on the flight and we would not be able to reach the gate in time. This was a really horrible experience. They told me that I would have to pay 1 lakh and 20 thousand rupees for just the return ticket which I of course did not buy. I ended up paying 85000 rupees for the return ticket with a different airline. I will never use or suggest Spicejet to any one.,no

SpiceJet,7,"""flight itself was pretty nice""",S Vashun,15th February 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Kolkata by SpiceJet. As this was a transfer flight to my final destination in Kolkata, the process was very smooth and boarding started well ahead of schedule. Again this flight by a former Jet Airways Boeing 737 and the crew seemed affable enough. I had pre booked the non veg and veg lunch meal for my family members which consisted of a chicken and egg biriyani as the non veg option and veg biriyani as the veg option. The food also had a bun and a cup of yoghurt and even though the meal was not bad, the quantities seemed to be on the lesser side. Landing was in time however I noticed that as the passengers were de-boarding, the crew did not thank the passengers and they had their backs turned instead of thanking the passengers and this was maybe the only negative in what was by and large a very good flight. The pre booked meal on Spicejet seemed to be of more quantity compared to other rival low cost carriers operating in India but still if one has to purchase in flight, it can get expensive as it starts from 250 INR onwards. Even though LCCs are in the habit of maximizing revenue as much as possible, one can be smart about this and perhaps have food before the flight. The flight itself was pretty nice.",yes
SpiceJet,7,"""should not have much expectations""",V Hanush,15th February 2020,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bengaluru by SpiceJet. For this morning service, there was massive lines for the baggage drop but eventually was able to drop the checked in luggage. It is important to come well in advance as one could easily miss their flight due to the serpentine nature of the queues. Before dropping the bags, it is important to print the boarding passes / bag tags from the kiosks. The flight was operated by a former Jet Airways aircraft, so the seating was more on the spacious side. Departure and arrival was on time. The crew were also good. I had asked for a glass of water only to be told that she would be giving me later but never did. Thankfully there was another crew member who provided the water. Unfortunately, for my aunt, the crew never really provided her any water when she made a similar request. As the flight was full, the crew managed to slowly get the service done but they did it quite well. While de-boarding, the crew thanked all the passengers which was good.

Our problems started at the check-in desk, where the woman checking us in visibly rolled her eyes at us when we approached the counter. When we arrived in Kochi, I was informed that my bag had been kept in Mumbai because of a powerbank (which the check-in lady did not ask us about). Now, I understand why they have this policy, and that's not the problem I had with SpiceJet, as I realize that part is my fault. The problem was how SpiceJet customer service handled it. No information, hanging up on me every time I called to check the status of my bag, needing me to send the appropriate paperwork multiple times before removing the powerbank and sending me my bag (which took over 48 hours). I don't understand why it's so difficult to simply remove the powerbank (which I gave permission to do) and send the bag. Yet for some reason, the people who work for this airline are completely incompetent. Not only that, but I received a message on WhatsApp that my bag was arriving on a certain flight, so I drove 1.5 hours to pick it up. But when I arrived, the bag was not on the flight! Instead, it was on the next flight which landed 3 hours later. Since we were about to leave Kochi and go to Alleppey, I had to wait for it. I spoke with the people working at the SpiceJet counter in Kochi airport, who didn't seem to care at all and kept saying ""well maybe it will come tomorrow"". I made it clear I wasn't leaving without the bag, and told them I'd wait for the next flight. I left to get some food, and when I returned, no one was there -- the counter was closed. Fortunately I was able to get the terminal manager to help me get my bag, but if they weren't going to be there, why the hell didn't they just say so when I told them I'd be returning? Truly a horrendous experience with SpiceJet customer service, both in person and on the phone -- completely unhelpful in every way possible. The second time we flew SpiceJet was no better, as we were charged double the price of our ticket to change our flight by one day (even though online it says you only have to pay the difference of the fares, which is a lie). On top of that, there were over $100 of hidden fees added to the ticket price, which we were not informed about until it was time to pay.

Why would the airline staff mislead a fare-paying passenger? More surprises. After a 2 hour delay, the flight crew was busy providing sample drinks and indulging in small talk with a group of passengers without any consideration that the rest of the passengers were trying to get some sleep.

I coordinated on my own with that partner with difficulty, as the employees are not well versed in basic English. 4. I registered complaint with them in writing, after running from pillar to post taking over an hour. 5. In the process I missed my pre-booked transportation to Pattaya (where I was travelling) and had to take a cab on-the-spot. I received my baggage afterwards coordinating with them.

Flight was delayed by 2 hrs 45 min. Your crew started serving food and beverage. I purchased a cup of tea by paying Rs. 100. But I found the tea was cold. I brought it to your crew, a lady. She asked me whether I had sipped the beverage. I answered, of course. But she didn’t believe me. To my utter surprise, she asked another co-passenger, who was also having tea, whether his beverage was hot enough. He responded, might be, 'yes'. She then turned to me and said, he is saying the tea is hot enough. To my utter disbelief, she poured some water from the pot. I didn't say anything but kept the cup full of tea or to be precise some lukewarm water and a piece of biscuit. I could have argued that my co passenger purchased the beverage when she began serving and I purchased while she was coming back from one round. But I didn't say anything. But I wonder how could a lady pour some water, maybe to her belief hot enough, to the cup of tea without even thinking that what would be the taste of the beverage.

SpiceJet,9,"""everything was flawless""",V Reddy,10th October 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | 
SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Bengaluru. This was a very good flight where everything went very smoothly from check in using the kiosk machines to the baggage drop, everything was flawless. The boarding started before the scheduled time which was a plus point and the flight was very full. One slight disadvantage is the need to pre pay the seat while doing online check in. However, if one arrives at the airport early enough one can select their seat preference without needing to pay the additional cost. But then this is a practice most LCCs do. The plane itself was used formerly by Jet Airways, so the seat pitch was on the more generous side which was well appreciated for a trip that was lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes long. We took off before departure time, the crew were proactive and personable enough with the fellow passengers when it came to the food / drinks. The pilots also announced and kept us updated regarding the flight path. Arrival was also well before the scheduled time and collecting the baggage was done quickly without the need to wait for long. Overall I'd say that on flights with longer durations, having a seat pitch which is more on the generous side really helps a lot. Would I consider flying SpiceJet again? If there is a good deal available.",yes

SpiceJet manged to be delayed (departure time) on 5 out of 4 planned flights: one flight was so delayed that I would not catch the connecting flight in Delhi - and I was not let on board. Thus I had to stay in Bangkok for one more day (no compensation for the hotel whatsoever). The next day, the plane was overcrowded - forget the extra leg room! Also, staff were always checking x-times if I was entitled for something to drink. It was an unpleasant and embarrassing experience. I will try to avoid SpiceJet at any cost.

SpiceJet,2,"""lot of false promises""",Dileep Kumar,10th October 2019,✅ Trip Verified | I recently took flight from Dubai to Pune and I can't believe what great cheats they are. First they are taking undue advantage of your situation and charging heavily for any excess baggage (approx 1400 INR per kg). I paid 15k for my excess baggage and they did that for most passengers and later all of our baggage was left behind as they did not have enough space in the flight and no information was provided to us. They just keep making money by accepting all there is to take. Upon landing in Pune they informed us what they have done and delivered a lot of false promises about refunds and compensation to pacify us. Later when I followed up with their customer care they didn't even bother to reply; cause they know they have already got the money and later when I complained again they bluntly refused to pay any compensation or refunds. They are extremely unprofessional and liars and cheats. Don't fall for their scams like me and from my experience I will tell you better to pay 1000 bucks extra and travel with other airline who don't do all this funny business and have better professionalism.,no

In particular, the staff on Kolkata-Chennai segment was very helpful, courteous, and pleasant. It's the crew that makes the airline, truly. On the other hand, the systems of SpiceJet are broken. Two examples: (1) On this same route, I had a ticket with all three segments under the same Record Locator. However, since a flight was modified by the reservation staff, their internal system showed them under different locators so I had to manually collect baggage and check-in baggage at every point - three check-ins, three baggage collections, and two re-check-ins! This needs to change. Airlines exist for customers, customers don't exist for airlines. (2) On a previous reservation that was cancelled by SpiceJet and refunded in full, the full refund was issued as a new transaction rather than reversal of the previous charge. Due to Exchange rate difference, this resulted in a loss of $7.95 to me, without having received anything other than headaches from SpiceJet.",yes

It’s pretty logical that if somebody is travelling abroad on a holida , one is bound to have a little excess baggage. A little bit of help could have changed our perception of the airlines.

SpiceJet,1,"""One of the worst experiences""",Deepali Bhamare,18th September 2019,"Not Verified |  Mumbai to Chennai. One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had with a flight. I was stuck in traffic and I knew I wouldn’t be able to make it before 45 mins, so I called the airline and they said they’d mark my PNR and send their staff to help me with the stuff. On reaching the airport and literally pushing everyone aside turns out there was no spicejet guy there to help us out. Moreover when we reached the check-in counter they refused to accept that we had our PNR nums marked and said that they couldn’t help us at all. Later, the senior executive came and spoke to us. Honestly, she couldn’t help us with the situation at all and later when we told her about the call center person who told us she’d arrange help, the senior executive asked for her name and asked us to call her back and if we couldn’t do that we could book another flight. She had a lot of attitude and just showed that she was least bothered in helping us. They have stupid officials at their call center who just know what to say or what to do. I’d strictly recommend anyone reading this to never use Spicejet as they have horrible services. This is just one of the most disastrous experiences I’ve ever had with any of the airlines. Later on, we had to book another flight to get back so yes we chose indigo which is a way better flight than spicejet. We had to book our tickets at the airport itself and since the ticket counter was very crowded the indigo official took us to book our tickets, took our baggage and made it very hassle free for us.",no

The staff have a poor attitude so don't expect any actual help. The planes are not the best or even good ones. They seem too old for 2019. Inflight service is alright. Staff have the same attitude in the air as on the ground. If your bag is detained, don't expect them to let you know.

SpiceJet,2,"""have never had such a disgusting experience""",Soham Panchamiya,18th September 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | An utterly terrible experience. My baggage was removed from the plane along with several other passengers. We were only informed about this after we had waited at the baggage rack for an hour in Dubai. This was at 12pm. Thereafter, we were told to come back at 3pm as our baggage would be flown in by then. Even though SpiceJet caused the issue, they refused to have our baggage delivered and they refused to compensate for costs to go to and from the airport (which is quite high in Dubai). When I got back to the airport to pick up my baggage at 3, they delayed further and we waited until 4.30-5 to get our luggage. The SpiceJet manager at Dubai airport refused to speak to us and was literally hiding in the SpiceJet office. Look, these things happen, but it is the airline's responsibility to do everything it can to ensure no further trouble is caused. I have never had such a disgusting experience with any other airline and will never, ever travel with SpiceJet ever again.",no
SpiceJet,3,"""I am highly disappointed""",Akansha Singh Gautam,18th September 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to Guwahati via Kolkata. I am highly disappointed by their service. I had requested them to put my baggage in the priority list and had paid extra as I was in a hurry for a bus which was soon after my flight. I have had travelled in Spicejet before and with my experience I already had a feeling that my Spicejet flight might be late; this is why I had demanded for the facility. But even then, they didn't put any priority tag on my luggage and my luggage arrived 15 mins late at the Guwahati airport. My first flight was 40 mins late, the next one being 20 mins late. I think spicejet needs to improve their services and at least provide the required services for the paid stuff, if not free.

With spice jet you should be careful while checking in, yes I understand 30kg is your limit, but I saw a gentleman being asked to remove even 1 kg extra. It's of course the airline policy but this was certainly something a airline staff could have handled better. Having checked in without any fuss, luckily, I was  excited as I was taking my 1st international trip with spice jet.  No one was allowed to check in hand luggage over 7 kgs, which includes duty free spirits and other items bought.  10000 rupees for hand carry without warning is insane.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""our whole trip was ruined""",Ujjval Jain,8th August 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had booked four tickets from Spice Jet to fly from Pune to Cochin.  It was a pre-planned holiday and two out of four were on their honeymoon. We had everything booked and scheduled - the cab, itinerary, hotel bookings and everything was paid in advance. Spice Jet being such a reputed and big airline spoiled the whole holiday with their unprofessional ignorant attitude.  We reached the Pune airport at 10 a.m. on 29 July as our flight was scheduled to fly at 11:25 a.m. and we issued the boarding pass on the kiosk and the same was sent to us on WhatsApp by Spice Jet team. We proceeded for the security check. Upon reaching there the security officer asked us to report at the check-in counter, at the counter we were shocked to know that the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours and later got cancelled due to some technical issues. Spice Jet officials straight away denied that they cannot do anything about it and we have to see something else on our own. After a lot of heated argument they agreed on shifting us to the immediate next flight from the Pune airport but we were given wrong information about the available flights too. There was a Go Air flight at around 1 p.m. which we agreed on taking to and later on they refused us to accommodate in that flight. We did not know what to do as we had a schedule to follow right after our landing in Cochin.  When we requested them for some other options, we were told there was a flight at 4 - 4:30 p.m. Indigo flight which is a direct flight to Cochin. We agreed as there were no other seats available in any other flight. But when I checked it online, it was via Bangalore that was taking about six hours to reach Cochin. Had I not checked it, they would have shifted us there with this misinformation. This is such an unprofessional behavior. If the flight is cancelled last minute then ethically they should support their customer who is suffering because of the last minute cancellation rather than giving up on them and providing them with wrong information. Then I checked the online flights available and saw Go Air had an available flight from Mumbai at 5:20 p.m. which was landing at 7:35 p.m. which was still suitable as we had time to reach the hotel at least. Spice Jet team first did not agree to this then after requesting to SpiceJet senior team member that our entire money will go waste, earlier he refused but after pursuing him a lot he booked us in the Go Air flight from Mumbai. The Spice Jet person after booking it told us that your bookings are done and we’ll offload you from the airport and you go and get a taxi on your own at around 11:45 a.m. Pune to Mumbai taxi fares are high, we were not prepared for it and also we were not liable to paid it too. When I requested they out rightly refused, after a lot of argument they agreed for the taxi. We took our flight from Mumbai and landed at Cochin at 7:30 p.m. Our whole day was spoiled because of the last minute flight cancellation. We are middle class people, we plan the holidays in advance and take a fixed budget. After this, our whole trip was ruined.",no

No other flights charge such an extra bag fee. I agreed to pay for the laptop bag as well, but asked the spicejet staff their IDs which they declined to provide, they get all our information and unwilling to provide their IDs, which would help me to complain against them.

I didn't buy anything since I had ate at the airport however, so I cannot comment about the food. On my return flight back to Hyderabad, I was put on an older Dash-8, which meant smaller seats, no reclining, and harder everything. Before/after this flight, I flew on IndiGo's ATR-72 from Tirupati to Hyderabad, which was so much better. If you want a cheap flight in India, don't choose SpiceJet, choose IndiGo, or even Air Asia India. Sometimes, Air India will be the cheapest option, which is a total win for me on a domestic flight, but not so internationally.

Travelled from a Jaisalmer and we were told that the flight would be delayed by 1h then ended up being delayed by around 3h. As a result of that, we missed our connection at Ahmedabad which was reasonably spaced at 3h from us landing. Upon landing we went to SpiceJet kiosk and staff was incredibly unhelpful telling us we need to buy new tickets to our destination. We ended up outside the airport, not being able to go back in arrivals or go into departures as we did not have a boarding ticket. We now need to wait for 4h until something is sorted by our insurance, in the heat, without water, food or toilets and with no help whatsoever from Spicejet. Poor airline with poor customer service.

Upon boarding, a choice of lime water or coconut water was given followed by cold towels. In the seat pocket, reading materials of newspapers and some magazines were present along with a small water bottle. Flight crew were super attentive and looked after us really well. H After take off, menu cards were handed out, which is great for a short 2 hour flight to Delhi. Lots of options to choose from and their dessert Tiramisu was extraordinary. After finishing of the meals, choice of tea and coffee was made along with choco-chip cookies. Good coffee! Finally, before landing a hot towel service.

There is no proper reason from SpiceJet staff why flight is getting delayed - earlier they told departure time 4:10 then said 4:30 and actually flight took off at around 5 AM. Due to this delay, I missed my flight from Mumbai to Bhopal. I complained to spicejet by email but they just say due to operational reasons it got delayed and no compensation can be provided at all. After few email exchanges they don't even bother about customers' concerns. I found their cabin crew is also rude and does not know how to treat their customers in flight.

Almost 70 baggage were offloaded due to overloading of flight reason. Then we were stranded at airport for almost 3hrs, the representative was arrogant, irresponsible and incompetent to even manage the issue. Today after 3 days there is no update on my luggage. Spice Jet is not only a low cost airline, i guess its also a low or no Service airline as well. I will surely make to avoid to use this airline in future.

My luggage was suspended in Mumbai airport and later I found that the reason was that I had a power bank inside my luggage. Spicejet said that they tried to call me but couldn’t get through as my no was an international one. They knew I had a UK no and Obviously anyone knows that they should have dialed 0044 before dialing my no? I checked in about 7:40 and there was plenty of time for them to inform me prior to taking off. Why didn’t they use the communication speaker sound system to call my name? I travelled all the way from the UK and Spicejet has managed to destroy my stay, why? I phoned the extremely unhelpful “helpline “some 5 times but they acted very unprofessional and were not helpful the slightest. I had all my very necessary belongings including my medicines in the luggage. There was no information anywhere re. Power bank restriction.  The check in staff could easily have either phoned me or called me through the airport speaking sound system. The Mumbai staff could have phoned the Cochin staff and informed them that my luggage was suspended in Mumbai rather than leaving me anxiously waiting for my luggage which never arrived. Spicejet staff could have been helpful and send my luggage to Cochin airport the same day. 5“Helpline” extremely Unhelpful at all times and never called me back for update. 6Finally when my luggage was sent to Cochin 3 very long and troublesome days later, my power bank was not in there. They could have easily put the power bank in the aircraft cabin. Spicejet said that they disposed of the power bank? My power was fairly new costed me £50 so surely someone is using it now.

SpiceJet,1,"""spicemax at a good price""",Gopan Sivasankaran,26th February 2019,"Not Verified |  I flew from Dubai to Kozhikode on 15th Feb. I had already paid for my seats etc for me and the family. At the checkin counter in Dubai airport, one of the staff approached me saying that he can offer me spicemax at a good price that includes extra leg room and free food. I said No initially - but then he said if i pay him 135AED , he can get this for 3 people. The term he used was ""buy 1 get 2 free"". I was tempted and made that payment. I entered the plane and got the second row. With the food option, the hostess asked me chicken or Veg, i said 1 chicken rest veg. She gave one sandwich and 2 chicken options and asked me to pay 60 AED. I asked why and she said that only the seats are included. I was not carrying cash and my wife was not carrying her wallet. I gave her my card and she said they dont accept. When i asked her - first of all , you didnt tell me that this is chargeable and secondly, you never told me that you accept only cash. She asked me to borrow money from some other passenger which i declined. After that what she said was horrifying ""Its a shame that you are coming from Dubai with family and you dont carry any cash"".",no

Had an important dinner meeting at BLR and booked 4.40 pm flight which was 8K costlier then the other flights available Initially SpiceJet delayed flight by some 30 min, which was OK looking at Indian standards. However once we were in cabin , they came up with an excuse of water leakage and delayed the flight by 2 hrs. Overall impact of this was that Missed an important business meeting. This was my last travel with SpiceJet and I would be careful in bookings next time.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""pay for an excess of 2kgs""",A Sharish,26th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Pune. SpiceJet is the worst airline in India. The line for check-in was 1 hour long! In short, for a domestic flight, you would have to reach before you are required to reach for an international flight. In Bengaluru SpiceJet counter, you can meet the most incompetent ground staff. Despite the long line, they were more interested in finding the tiniest fault possible and charging outrageous amounts as excess baggage. This was the first time that I had been asked to pay for an excess of 2kgs and Rupees 800 for the same. The lady at the check-in counter would rather let me go and repack with the line waiting behind me, than just wave off the matter and check me in.",no

For me, this is the last time I'll be flying SpiceJet.",no
SpiceJet,8,"""Worst flight experience""",H Kubash,26th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kanpur to Delhi. Worst flight experience ever. The ground staff was very non cooperative, the handbag was asked to be put in checkin to earn money. The low carrier airline tag is just a ruse to fetch money from people by charging them with things like your baggage is 57cm and not 55cm - airbag with wheels is not allowed. With 2 tickets our checkin baggage was within the limit but because they added our hand baggage to Our checkin we were asked to pay extra- and they charge a hefty amount of 400Rs per kg. The rest of the Journey was made worse by the under construction Kanpur airport, they have limited staff and faulty equipment which makes the passenger experience a terrible ordeal.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""Worst experience""",Kamal Gupta,26th February 2019,✅ Trip Verified | Bengaluru to Delhi. Worst experience. Travelled several times Indigo but never faced issue.

SpiceJet,1,"""do this re-scheduling a lot""",S Manehar,26th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mangalore to Bangalore. The flight was originally scheduled at 7.35 PM and got postponed to 9.15 PM a week before the scheduled date. And looks like they do this re-scheduling a lot. Why have so many itineraries to select from while booking if you actually cannot run those? I called up the Customer Care and requested to change the flight to 5.40 PM which is available, just so that the risk of missing the connecting flight is less. But I was told about the policies and stuff that I have to pay the Ticket Fare + Change Penalty if I have to get it changed. Seriously guys!? is this what you call customer service? The flight is re-scheduled by 15 Min less than 2 Hrs which is the minimum time interval required for the ticket to be rescheduled free of cost according to ""Policy"". When you say ""Sorry, we regret the inconvenience caused"", at least try to make up to the customer rather than making more money out of the customer's inconvenience.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""flight delayed by 5 hours""",Roshith Kattungal,26th February 2019,Not Verified |  Cochin to Chennai. Worst experience in flying. The flight was delayed by 5 hours and the crew had no information even about the time at which flight was rescheduled. They could have at least informed in advance so that I could have opted for another flight. Even though they know about the matter they kept mum. Never opt for this flight.,no
SpiceJet,1,"""bad and worst experience""",Sailaja Sarbada,26th February 2019,✅ Trip Verified |  Bangalore to Hyderabad. Worst experience. No proper response from the SpiceJet team. In the check in queue all not sending passengers in queue . Least bothered staff. Also flight got delayed by 30 mins but no information until asked. When I went and asked they are telling like we updated in the board but they updated the time I asked. Unprofessional people. Really very bad and worst experience.,no
SpiceJet,3,"""really bad service""",L Sharma,26th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Bangkok. Good price but really bad service. They did not carry enough water bottles for all the passengers. In fact, they did not even have much food or other beverage options for customers on the later rows of the plane. They had one bottle of water for 10 rows at the back. Had to call the attendant multiple times to get anything at all. Seats were ok, not too bad. The flight was also hot since the AC wasn't too effective. Only use as last resort if you don't have other flight options available. Much better to pay more for other airlines.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""worst airline company""",R Sharman,1st January 2019,✅ Trip Verified |  Guwahati to Pakyong. Spicejet is the worst airline company. They cancel flights when they could not sell there full tickets and blame the cancellation to bad weather condition. They do not have the decency to inform the passengers beforehand so that they can arrange for an alternative. You will know about the cancellation at airport. Thereafter you will have to run to Spicejet office and request them to refund your money.,no
SpiceJet,1,"""always a delay""",Rohit Suri,1st January 2019,Not Verified | Jaipur to Varanasi. Consistent airline - always a delay! I have an experience of delay in all trips while travelling with Spicejet. It takes something to be so consistent in wasting the passengers time. The ground staff is arrogant while addressing the issue. They are obviously obliging you by providing you the airlines although the flight attendants are courteous. Need to learn to be punctual and timely intimating the passengers about the delay.,no
SpiceJet,1,"""ticket without check in baggage""",Subhrajit Chakravorty,1st January 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Silchar.

Seeing this 2 bags spicejet charged me Rs 400/- extra.",no
SpiceJet,1,"""improve before its too late""",M Kaliya,1st January 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Coimbatore to Delhi. Improve before its too late. I don’t usually do this but the reason for writing this review is manifold. Firstly, the delay in flight time owing to poor weather conditions, its hard to comprehend how other airlines can operate on time in similar conditions. I just hope the delay was not caused to the airline staff. Secondly, if flight is delayed then the same can be conveyed well in advance to avoid any inconvenience to a lady travelling with a toddler. Thirdly, this really tested my patience, the rude and indifferent behaviour of the lady at the counter at Coimbatore airport. She was not not considerate enough to check in the hand baggage meant for the baby and insisted that the same should be caaried in cabin. I wonder if its the AUW that counts and other airlines can consider, why same thing could not be replicated by the Spice jet. Overall, it was a nightmare and a horrible experience. I wish I didn't have to travel this airline again. For you own sake, improve before its too late.",no

Spicejet not at all customer friendly, charging 400 INR/ kg for extra baggage is too much. I paid 4000 rs for extra 10 kg which is equal to my flight ticket cost.

There is no Priority check-in. Food is average. Flight was around 1hr of delay. Finally no priority bag out. So guys, please don't book Spice max, They are just grabbing money from you. Its completely useless. I had very worst experience with Spice jet. I'm Gold member of Jet airways. Unfortunately I didn't get seat that day. I'll never come again Spice jet. I won't recommend to anyone.",no

I had only hand luggage. They really check the weight, so make sure you only bring 7 kilos or take something out before they weigh it. They only provide you one cup of free water (maybe you can ask for more), but it was no problem to bring my own little bottle of water. When your luggage get checked at the airport, they don't throw the bottle away. For food you have to pay and it seemed like they have only factory fabricated kind of food. But this was also no problem, as my flights were very short. The flight attendants were young girls and they were friendly. I experienced it overall as good.",yes
SpiceJet,2,"""they are so inefficient""",Seana Harvey,2nd December 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jaipur to Goa via Ahmedabad . Save your money and don’t fly with them. 4.5 hours turned into 8.5 hrs. More time was spent waiting than actually in air flying. No communication was given as we were herded like sheep from one security point to the next. Initially the flight was late 1.5 hours. We flew to Ahmedabad which was 55 minutes. The same plane flight was to continue on to Goa. However it didn’t. Everyone continuing on to Goa was asked to stay seated and present their ticket. Ten minutes later another passenger informed us we had to change planes. We exited to a bus which took us out of the airport then back in- through security once again then made to wait an additional 2.5 hours. Originally to be in Goa at 4:10pm actual arrival 8:30pm. Not to mention their staff is terrible, no smiles, compassion, communication. I was shocked at how little we were told about what was going on. I thought Spicejet was a reputable company but they are so inefficient it’s ridiculous. They did off meal vouchers for the inconvenience. I would have preferred a customer service agent that didn’t stare blankly and say he accepted the situation but would do nothing to resolve it.",no

In SpiceJet the seat arrangements are very compact as compared to other airlines, you can't stretch your legs properly. There will be no complementary food, you have to pay for food.

I asked the staff to take it away to which she replied leave it there, I'll take it later. Actually, you should have taken it away even before you started boarding. Spicejet is a very cheap and fast way to travel but I guess that does not mean you can drop your standards that low, leaving dirty cutlery from the last passengers for the new ones. I am still paying big bucks.",no

After reaching airport I got to know the flight is delayed by 3 hrs, I had received no message or email so I decided to postpone my trip to next day after paying 4k as penalty for rescheduling IndiGo to next day and guess what next - same story next day. Moral of the story is Spicejet sucks. Rating negative. Never recommend.",no

Like many have said on this site, this is probably the worst Indian airline to travel with. In comparison with IndiGo or Vistara, nothing is free, you must pay for everything. The ticket price is not that cheap compared to other Indian airline, the story began when the flight was delayed for more than an hour without communication with us. After that, we boarded an old plane with nothing onboard - tight legroom, rude staff, A/C not working, toilet disgusting etc. Luckily, the flight was not that and was still able to made in to my flight at 10 pm to get on my flight to SE Asia via Dubai. My advice - don't travel on Spicejet if you can help. Try and fly another airline whenever possible.",no
